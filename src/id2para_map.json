Currently all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Cindy McCann, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin.Cindy McCann: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call are John Mackey and Walter Robb, Co-Chief Executive Officers; A.C. Gallo, President; Glenda Flanagan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Sud, Executive Vice President of Growth & Development; and David Lannon and Ken Meyer, Executive Vice Presidents of Operations. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed today. This may be due to a variety of factors, including the risks outlined in our Company\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-K. Our press release and scripted remarks are now available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Walter Robb.Walter Robb: Thanks, Cindy and good afternoon everyone from beautiful Austin, Texas. We\u2019re pleased with our Q1 results, which reflect continued market share gains, healthy returns and a strong start to fiscal year 2015. Sales grew over 10% to $4.7 billion with comparable store sale growth accelerating on one and a two-year basis. With broad based momentum across departments, storage, classes and regions we believe our many strategic initiatives along with improving consumer confidence are collectively contributing to our improved results. Here are some of the highlights of our progress in Q1.", "1": " It was a real boost to team morale and we\u2019re looking forward to the final brand tracking study results. The early read is very positive indicating a 100% increase in awareness for our target audience with increases in both value perception and intent to shop versus our measured competitors. We are now providing fresh grocery delivery options to more homes in America than any other food retailer. Since announcing our 15-market partnership with Instacart in September, our average weekly online delivery sales have already passed the $1 million mark. With online delivery sales as high as 5% of total sales in some of our stores, we\u2019re very excited about the future potential as we expand our reach to more markets, provide richer content highlighting our quality standard and broaden our product offering. A great example is happening this week for Valentine\u2019s Day we\u2019re offering flower delivery in as little as one-hour with prices starting at $25 for a dozen of our high-quality ethically sourced whole-trade roses. Orders can be placed in advance, and combine with the ability to include chocolates or some other treats, this is a deal that\u2019s hard to beat. With, the largest Apple Pay retailer in terms of both transactions and sales, further reinforcing the notion that our customer base wants to take advantage of the latest digital technologies. This payment option has grown quickly to 2% of sales which we expect will continue to increase especially after the Apple Watch launches this year. We are exploring opportunities to extend this successful partnership, including expanding functionality to support our affinity program. Speaking of, we are pleased with the results of our 12-store affinity test which shows high activation and registration rates and above average basket sizes for participants. We are continuing to incorporate customer feedback as we upgrade and add new features to this program, and recently added some new talent to lead our efforts in this area. We\u2019re excited to expand the pilot to our Washington DC customers this spring, with hopes of having the program live in a majority of our stores for the 2015 holiday season. And as promised, our new and improved Whole Foods Market app is now live with nearly 600,000 downloads to date, iOS, Android users can access personalized and local store offers, events and information along with 3,700 tested recipes where ingredients can be added to shopping list with a single tap. Stay tuned for more unique and exciting features and upgrades throughout the year. We recognize the changing technology and growing demand for customization that fundamentally altered retailing forever.", "2": " And it\u2019s part of our broader digital roadmap, we are rapidly building out an extended customer experience beyond the four walls of our stores. At the same time, we believe the customers will always want the human connection, the sense of community and the unparalleled shopping environment our stores deliver. As we accelerate our new store openings and step-up refreshes of our older stores, we are focused on evolving a richer customer experience to innovation, improve value and higher levels of transparency on all the products that we sell. In Q1, we opened nine new stores expanding into Ottawa, Canada, and revitalizing our brand with new large flagships in both Houston and Boston. After opening our first taproom in 2010, we now have over 100 taprooms and wine-bars companywide. Our post Oak store in Houston took the next step debuting our first ever in-store micro-brewery. Our second brewery is already open and we expect many more to come. We refreshed 40 stores and on track to complete 200 by year-end. While results vary depending on the scope of the project and a variety of other factors, stores typically seen immediate sales lift and we expect these investments to be one of the many factors contributing the sales momentum this year and beyond. We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce price we\u2019re testing in several markets, which included external marketing to support these investments. It is too early for conclusive results particularly given the holidays. However, we\u2019re looking to expanding the test to additional markets as we believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception. We launched our responsibly grown rating system which assesses growing practices and impact human health in the environment, and prohibit some of the most harmful pesticides. We believe these ratings draw clear lines of differentiation between our produce our floral departments and those of our competitors. The program has been well received by suppliers and customers and close to 60% of our produce is already rated. We have seen the power of our differentiated standards in other areas such as meat and seafood and believe are responsibly growing ratings in produce will see similar success over time. And after just two years of setting a deadline for full GMO transparency by 2018, we are well on our way with over 25,000 certified organic items and over 8,500 non-GMO project verified products in our stores.", "3": " A 20-basis point decline in gross margin was partially offset by a 4-basis point improvement in SG&A. It remains our intention to offset the impact of our strategic initiatives with improvements in our cost structure over the longer term. However the timing of investments and the cost cuts may not align as was the case this quarter. Excluding $13 million or 28 basis points of estimated incremental marketing costs related to the launch of our brand campaign, SG&A improved 33 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits, more than offsetting the 20-basis point decline in gross margin. EBITDA margin was 8.5% and EPS increased 10% to $0.46. For the last eight quarters, our new store classes averaged sales per square gross square foot of $709 translating the productivity levels of 82% on a weighted square footage basis. Comp stores less than two years old have averaged 17% comps and most importantly a 14% return on invested capital well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Please see our press release for more details on our outlook for this year and note that we estimate this year\u2019s Easter shift will positively impact comps in Q2 and negatively impact comps Q3 by about 50 to 60 basis points. As we look forward, we see more opportunities for the Whole Foods Market brand than ever before. We have a deep and seasoned leadership team and have been adding some fantastic new talent. Our strong and vibrant culture contributes to low turnover and high morale which helps create a great customer experience. The demand for fresh healthy foods continues to surge and we are best positioned to benefit as the leading retailer of natural organic foods in America\u2019s healthiest grocery store. We are committed to continuing to improve and evolve. And with 400 Nat-stores and 116 signed leases, we have confidence that we will cross the 500-store mark in 2017 and triple our store-base over the longer-term. We will now take questions. Call will end at 4:45 p.m. Central Time. So to allow for more time for questions, please limit yourself to one question at a time, that way everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.Rupesh Parikh: Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. So maybe I\u2019ll just start with your initiatives.", "4": " So as you look at your performance this past quarter, is there a way to isolate maybe which initiatives you believe had the largest positive impact thus far?Walter Robb: Well, this is Walter, we anticipated that question. And we talked a lot about ourselves. And really the correct answer is we think it\u2019s all of them contributing to the momentum. Because the comp results are broad-based across the company and storage classes, it just suggested every single of these things gained some - it really helped us to gain some additional traction.Rupesh Parikh: Okay, thank you. And then just one more, just on store remodels. How far along are we now in the process? And how the storage models would respond to that your expectations?David Lannon: Hi everybody, this is David. Yes, we\u2019re - we actually were very pleased that we were able to accomplish 40 refreshes in the first quarter, which has the holidays in it. So we were able to work our way around the holidays. And we\u2019ve got some great results. Chicago, where we\u2019re just about to open a lot of stores with our Dominic\u2019s that we\u2019ve turning into new Whole Foods. We finished a full remodeling Lake View, we were forced to refresh, Gold Coast to refresh, Tamarac in Denver, store like Reno, this is all new d\u00e9cor, new graphics, just a whole new look. And we\u2019re seeing like, as Walter described, great results in all these stores. And so, I would say in the next quarter we\u2019re going to accelerate because we\u2019ll have more time without the holidays. So we\u2019ll be doing a lot of work in the next few quarters.Operator: And we can take our next question from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.Charles Grom: Thanks good afternoon. When you guys, when you evaluate your cost structure and you look at the P&L and direct store expenses, G&A, corporate overhead. I guess, where do you guys think the biggest opportunity is to get leaner in the years ahead and can we dive into that topic a little bit? Thanks.John Mackey: I mean, I think it\u2019s John here. I think it\u2019s everywhere. We\u2019re getting leverage right now as we continue to grow.", "5": " I mean, we\u2019re very proud that we took out over 200 basis points in our cost structure in the last five years. And I think it\u2019s reasonable to conclude we can do the same thing on a go-forward basis. But it just requires a lot of hard work, I mean, obviously if we knew exactly the big areas to cut we\u2019d already have done that. So, it\u2019s about working on it, studying it, making it our priority which is what our regional presidents were doing and our executive vice presidents for operations. We\u2019re very cautious of the fact that we need to take cost out of our system. And we\u2019ve done it in the past, and we\u2019re going to continue to do it going forward.Walter Robb: This is Walter, I\u2019ll just add Chuck that, in addition to the looking up and down the P&L for the cost savings and we\u2019ve talked previously about distribution, purchasing and store labor. But also process changes and the way we do business and we\u2019ve talked last quarter about our efforts around re-thinking our company and how we do business and in areas such as data and in purchasing. These areas, there is, opportunities to make process change, business process changes resulting in being more productive. So that\u2019s an area we\u2019re looking at hard together right now.Charles Grom: Okay. And this is a follow-up to, just when you think about reinvesting some of those cost savings, what are you looking to see from a unit in elasticity to reinvest those cost cuts back into two more produce items around the permit of the store and expanding to other markets beyond Austin?Walter Robb: To be clear, we\u2019re looking at three buckets. We\u2019re looking at the price investments. We\u2019re looking at marketing and continuing our brand building efforts and third in the area of technology capability that we described a lot on the call today. But I think it\u2019s a little early to give you direct answer on the produce because we\u2019re still really evaluating, we have like four or five tests going on and we\u2019ve stepped up a couple more. And I think we\u2019ll have more to say about that but I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re seeing good unit lift already. Do you want to add to that John, or?John Mackey: Well, we\u2019re a public company.", "6": " But it\u2019s been our experience that market often times overreacts to anything we do. So, the juggling act will be to continue to make price investments, continuing investment technology, continue to take cost out of the system as we can and hopefully this will be not perfectly aligned. But we think we can do it in such a way that we can continue sort of in the same type of upward trajectory that we\u2019ve been doing. And we have to evaluate how is our marketing, how did it do. I mean, when we did the national television advertisement, we\u2019re actually very happy with it but it\u2019s hard to know exactly, we know how many impressions we got, it\u2019s hard to know how much that drove sales. We\u2019re making technology investments. We think that\u2019s going to help us to be more profitable in the long run. But we still have a lot of work ahead of us. So, I think the company just kind of focus on these areas and we\u2019re going to continue to work to take cost out of our system. And hopefully that we\u2019ll be able to grow our sales and grow our comps and make all our stakeholders happy simultaneously that\u2019s what we strive to do.Walter Robb: Thanks Chuck.Operator: And our next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is now open.Meredith Adler: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was going to ask you about sort of what you\u2019re seeing with the produce tests, but as you said you would say more about that shortly, so I won\u2019t ask that. Question about if you can talk at all about the loyalty program you\u2019re working on. Can you just give us any sense of what it looks like, because you don\u2019t have a regular promotional program, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re transferring that to the card. So, can you say anything more about what you\u2019re doing?Walter Robb: Well, this is Walter, I\u2019ll take a shot. I mean, it\u2019s early, 12 stores. And we deliver, we are going fast with the development, we\u2019re doing it interactively. So that will incorporate in the feedback from customers as we go. But I mean, it\u2019s a combination of card and app.", "7": " But actually additional benefits, additional loyalty, curetting some sort of an individual relationship for the customer. And it\u2019s really, we\u2019re just - I think what we\u2019re seeing so far is that people are responding to it. The registrations are higher than we expected. The basket size is very good it\u2019s close to $100 on that program. So granted it could be that those are some of our better customers that are using it but it\u2019s still a very good result in terms of the basket sizes coming out there. I think we\u2019re just really, we have a great team working on it and we\u2019re really focused on continue to improve the brand of it as well as the experience of it. And that\u2019s where we are right now.Meredith Adler: Great. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.Operator: And our next question comes from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Ryan Gilligan: Hi, it\u2019s actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Do you guys have an early estimate on what the front-end scheduling opportunity could mean to margins?Walter Robb: This is the labor scheduling?Ryan Gilligan: Yes, that\u2019s right.Ken Meyer: This is Ken, can you repeat the question?Ryan Gilligan: Yes, sorry. I was asking if you have an early estimate for what that could mean to margins?Ken Meyer: It\u2019s too early to have any information on that. I could tell you that we were active with the roll-out with the anticipation that the customer service teams will be all in-line by the end of the fiscal year \u201815. And right now we\u2019re in the process of redefining our business processes and laying in the technology into that to create the new sort of set of operating practices related around the front-end and customer service. So that\u2019s basically where we are with that. We\u2019re really excited about the tool. We think it\u2019s going to be incredible add to the ability for us to schedule effectively and serve the customers.Ryan Gilligan: Got it. And then just quickly on the remodels. How much of the sales lift, the remodels or sales that were recovered from the younger stores by the older stores?", "8": " Did you understand, John? Okay, got it good.John Mackey: I mean, we think it\u2019s mostly incremental. What you\u2019re saying is, if we do a refresh that we might have some cannibalization of stores. I think that\u2019s probably is a little bit of that. But we think it\u2019s mostly incremental of taking it from our competitors rather than from ourselves.David Lannon: Yes, if you look at examples like I mentioned Reno, that\u2019s a standalone store by itself. And it doubled its comp rate after the refresh. So and that doesn\u2019t affect store.Walter Robb: Good result.Ryan Gilligan: Great, thanks.Operator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Edelstein with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.Joe Edelstein: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping that you could quantify the impact from the pricing investments for the quarter and maybe just for the gross margin line or if you even want to refer to kind of the basket dollar growth. And then related to that, I was hoping you could even also comment just on the second quarter to date information, it does look like the basket growth just slipped a little bit. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s mix related or perhaps you\u2019re even getting a bit more aggressive with that price investment?Glenda Flanagan: This is Glenda, I\u2019ll answer your second question first, which is the second quarter results are for three weeks only. And we had a lot of weather about last year and this year that are skewing the results. So, it\u2019s very difficult to look at that and try to get too much information from it. So I caution you against doing that. And we are not quantifying the - what you\u2019re asking us for. We just want to say that we\u2019re in a very early position in the produce price investments. And we\u2019re continuing to look at what we\u2019re doing so far and tweaking it. And we have planned to roll it out as we said to more markets and do more tests in the quarters ahead. So, hopefully we will be able to get better information at some point but we\u2019re not prepared to do that this time.Walter Robb: And I guess, its Walter. I would just point you to looking at the growth of the transaction count.", "9": " And so that\u2019s much more the story I think in the basket as to see nice growth there.Joe Edelstein: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I\u2019m also curious how would you characterize the competitive responses to your price investments at this point, is it still the case as it was kind of last quarter, prior quarters where others have been matching your moods?A.C. Gallo: Hi, this is A.C. It varies, we have seen some especially when you\u2019re often when you start a campaign in a particular area, a lot of times competitors will react to it. And then they\u2019ll back off a little bit over time. So we\u2019ve seen a little bit of that. We\u2019ve been in some other markets where people have some competitors haven\u2019t addressed it at all to what we\u2019re doing. So, it\u2019s kind of all over the, it\u2019s kind of all over the math. And I mean, I think eventually people wind up going back to what their normal strategy was after the initial reaction to what you do.John Mackey: Yes, John here. One thing to understand is that in only few of our markets, just Whole Foods Market have like the leading market share for food, in supermarkets or food retailing. I mean, in almost all of our markets but maybe a few, we are, our market share is relatively low. We\u2019re not, I mean, we, the point of it is, is we\u2019re not a big threat to a major supermarket who dominates the market. It doesn\u2019t make, in most cases, it doesn\u2019t make much economic sense for them to go overreact and lower all their produce prices to try to match Whole Foods Market because they\u2019re destroying our profitability or harming our profitability for very little market share gains. So this is an example, we\u2019re not having a big market share work to our advantage because supermarkets either won\u2019t reach or they won\u2019t - we don\u2019t think they hold the prices for a long period of time A.C. may mentioned to. So, yes, I mean, for the most part I think only one or two markets has, they have been much of a reaction at all.Joe Edelstein: Thanks for the comments. And good luck this year.Walter Robb: The customers reacted though.", "10": " Your line is now open.Ken Goldman: Hi, thank you for the question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible I missed, but I don\u2019t think you provided ID sales or sales per square foot produce stores this period. If I just missed it, I apologize, but if possible, could you help us out with those figures?Glenda Flanagan: We have started reporting ID sales, and we did report new store productivity in the scripted comments.Ken Goldman: Okay, I missed that, I\u2019ll go back.Glenda Flanagan: It was $709.Ken Goldman: Okay, thank you. And if I could speak one more, and the gross margin down 20 basis points year-on-year. I think that was probably close to what you anticipated internally if I\u2019m reading you right. But were there any surprises in terms of the drivers of that number either positively or negatively?Walter Robb: This is Walter, not really, no. I think what we said is we expected to be down sequentially more this year than last year in the sort of 20 to 25 basis points range, it still seems like that\u2019s the path we\u2019re on as John mentioned. That represents the balancing of all these various things they were up to. And we\u2019re actually kind of right on the path we expected to be.Ken Goldman: Great, thanks very much.Operator: And we can take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Vincent Sinisi: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask you about the refreshes. If you can give any further color regarding the 40 that you recently refreshed in terms of was an overwhelming majority more towards a lighter refresh or versus more towards a full-blown remodel? And then maybe if you can also talk about the 200 that you have earmarked by year-end, kind of what levels of refresh are you expecting?David Lannon: Yes, David here. So really the strategy we came up with was based on our great experience in Southern California, in some of the old Whole Foods Markets in the company, the former Mrs. Gooch\u2019s. And we saw that the results of just doing lighter refreshes, essentially new color, new d\u00e9cor, new flooring sometimes, some new lighting.", "11": " And it really we saw an immediate sales boost. So we essentially with the 200 refreshes, we\u2019re primarily talking about d\u00e9cor, putting up to the most up-to-date look and feel of our stores, stores like Brooklyn, New York, things like that. We\u2019re trying to, we\u2019re looking at some of the way those stores feel. And so, it\u2019s mainly d\u00e9cor and that kind of stuff. But we do, every year we do a significant remodeling across our stores, adding new concepts like juice bars. Can you add anything to that?John Mackey: I\u2019d say, in the middle of that class you have sort of where we\u2019re adding new cases, new programs and taking the latest things that we\u2019ve done in our newest stores and then implementing them into the existing stores throughout the group of stores in different region. So a lot of the new product work that A.C. is working on in private label and frozen product requires more freezer doors, more dairy space. So we\u2019re adding cases in the growth areas of the business.Vincent Sinisi: Okay, very helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up question to that, I know you mentioned the Reno location earlier. But as a class, are those 40 refreshes - would it be safe to say that the comp lift that you\u2019re seeing in total is maybe within a few hundred basis points between some of the ones that were seen the most versus the least up-lift?Walter Robb: It gets murky so there is lot of other factors. I don\u2019t think you could actually say that too.Vincent Sinisi: Yes, okay. All right, no, fair enough. Thanks very much and best of luck.Walter Robb: Thank you.Operator: And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.Chuck Cerankosky: Good evening everyone. When you are looking at the improved customer confidence you mentioned, how is it showing up in your perishable sales max, as far as the more loyal customers when you talk about it overall and in the growing basket size? And is it trading up with the loyal customers?Walter Robb: This is Walter. Looking at the, we saw pretty good growth in all the basket sizes, and particularly with on the higher-end baskets, they continue to grow nicely.", "12": " And we offer the consumer confidence is kind of a backdrop. And we have correlated the consumer confidence index to comps to look at what the relationship there but I think this has more to do this quarter with our particular efforts in these different areas that together combined have created a positive momentum for the company.Chuck Cerankosky: Sorry to separate everything, what do you feel is more way to do what you\u2019re doing in your ultimate pricing effort?Walter Robb: Definitely, absolutely, yes, I think we took charge and did some things and I think they\u2019re working.Chuck Cerankosky: All right. Thank you.Walter Robb: You\u2019re welcome.Operator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.Scott Mushkin: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I was wondering if we had any idea what CapEx is going to be for the year, I know you\u2019re doing a lot of remodels on these stores. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen that number yet. Any thoughts on where that\u2019s going to come in?Glenda Flanagan: Scott, we did not give CapEx guidance for the year. If you look at the first quarter though, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s, remember its 16 weeks. And on a weekly basis if you average that out, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we had in Q4. We certainly have, we have to look at the numbers, new stores in the year. But I think, I bet you can get pretty close.Scott Mushkin: So, you just kind of used that run rate as a good run rate for the year, is that what you\u2019re saying?Glenda Flanagan: Yes. I mean there is nothing significantly different than in prior years or anything significantly different than current quarter trends.Scott Mushkin: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s really good guidance. And then my next question is regarding competition, I mean, clearly this has been a focus of the market, it\u2019s been a focus of some of the stuff that we\u2019ve done. Costco adding in a lot of stuff, Targets can add in a lot of organics, Kroger\u2019s been. What are your guys thoughts about the, I know back in the 2000s, John you mentioned that, you thought it was good when these companies were doing this.", "13": " Gallo: Hi, it\u2019s A.C. It\u2019s a real dynamic changing marketplace. We do see products in a lot of price - lot of organic products going to lot of different retailers. It\u2019s interesting we had recent meetings with lot of our top suppliers. And some of them were telling us that as soon as the product hits our shelves they get calls from other competitors saying we want that product too. So we kind of take the pride of being the first of getting products on the shelf. And that\u2019s what we do, we really innovate. A lot of our culture is about innovation. And so, there is, we know that in this kind of market, people are going to be looking to sell lot of the products we do, because they know that we\u2019ve been successful. And it\u2019s our job to keep innovating and coming up with new products, new things like responsibly grown produce program continuing to push our animal welfare and our sustainable seafood and all those kinds of things. So, it\u2019s really a challenge to us to continue to grow and innovate and that\u2019s what gets us excited. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing and that\u2019s where our focus is.Scott Mushkin: Do you think you\u2019re going to have to price some of these liquid items where these competition are priced or is that not going to be a problem?John Mackey: I mean, Whole Foods is about quality, it\u2019s about service, it\u2019s about selection, it\u2019s about ambience. We\u2019ve never been and we never will be trying to be the lowest priced supermarket that\u2019s sort of not very attractive, doesn\u2019t give very good service. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. I mean that\u2019s a valid niche in the marketplace just to be at a low priced, low-cost operator. But that\u2019s not Whole Foods\u2019 strategy. Our strategy has always been about the quality and the service and the selection. And yes, I mean, competition is harder today than it used to be, but on the other hand, Whole Foods is a lot better today than it used to be. In fact, competition, it is your ally. It\u2019s your ally that helps you to get better. It knocks you out of your complacency. It keeps you from being lazy, it forces you to evolve.", "14": " And when we are challenged, when competition rears its head, we respond. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. We\u2019re responding, we\u2019re evolving, we\u2019re getting better we\u2019re getting better quicker than our competitors are. So, they\u2019re chasing us still and maybe they\u2019ve closed the gap a little bit but we\u2019re accelerating our innovation cycle. So, I think that\u2019s something people have never understood about Whole Foods Market. They think we\u2019re going to sit still and let people catch us. But we\u2019re not going to sit still. We\u2019re going to rapidly innovate and improve, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done for over 35 years and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do going forward.Walter Robb: Yes, and I guess Scott, just to add to that Scott. We\u2019re going to be relevant on price. We said that before, we say it again. Our tracking of competitor\u2019s pricing and indexes is much more sophisticated now than it was two or three years ago. We know where we stand relative to the others. And yes, of course, on the items that are ubiquitous, we\u2019re going to be in and we\u2019re going to have to price them right. And we understand that and that\u2019s part of where some of these investments are going and where we continue to, where we\u2019ve kind of laid out the path over the next few years. But it all fits within the broader context John just laid out about how we think about go into market and competing and showing up as leading retailer in the marketplace.Scott Mushkin: Perfect, thanks guys. I really appreciate the color.Operator: And we can take our next question from David McGee with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.David McGee: Yes, hi, good afternoon everybody.Walter Robb: Good afternoon.David McGee: First question has to do with the home delivery, it sounds like it\u2019s gotten very good traction thus far in certain stores. I\u2019m curious, how much penetration does it get in the store, would you expect? And then secondly, how of that business do you think is additive versus sort of cannibalizing the store?David Lannon: This is David. We really, we\u2019re having great partnership with our friend in Instacart. We\u2019re working super-close together with them.", "15": " And we\u2019re looking, we feel like we\u2019ve just scratched the surface, this week with the Valentine\u2019s promotions and new thing, we really haven\u2019t touched prepared foods we really haven\u2019t started with that business yet. And that\u2019s coming. So we\u2019re adding products all the time. And we\u2019re working with Instacart to, we\u2019re starting to actually reach capacity in some of our stores and needing to add more stores where the Instacart shoppers shop in some of our cities. And it\u2019s really just the beginning, it\u2019s early days. But the sales are real, we\u2019re seeing some exciting stuff with the bad weather lately where we\u2019re seeing orders really take off before bad weather. So we\u2019re picking up some additional sales that were lost to the bad weather before. Instacart adds additional shoppers in the days like that. So, all good news.Walter Robb: We do have incremental business here, we have a working number inside that\u2019s pretty good size. And I think I\u2019d like to have a run it a little bit before we started to talk about that. But it\u2019s not insignificant in terms of incremental business, so.John Mackey: Yes, and if you look over the long-run, I mean, Whole Foods Market is not going to have a supermarket on every corner. And yet we have very loyal customers. So we\u2019ll begin to get more of the convenience business through Instacart than we\u2019ve ever had before. It\u2019s because, let\u2019s say they come to Whole Foods after driving past other supermarkets to come to Whole Foods, and they do that maybe once a week or once every couple of weeks. But now with Instacart, if they need to pick up a quarter mil for and they pick up some berries for their cereal, they can just order from Instacart, they don\u2019t need to go drive over to one of our competitors who might be closer than Whole Foods. So I think there will be some cannibalization of course, and there will be incremental sales that we get. So and as Walter and David said, it\u2019s so early, I mean, it\u2019s so early in this. And we\u2019ll have so much more information a year from now than we have today.", "16": " And we are seeing some exciting steps being taken in terms of long-distance ordering where customers live in one place but their kids live in another place, where Instacart is and they can still shop at Whole Foods, the college kids, parents. So the expansion of Whole Foods shopping universe is growing.David McGee: Thank you sounds good. And just one quick follow-up. On the marketing side, it sounds like you\u2019re pretty happy with the national ad, sort of the values marketing. Are you doing any local advertising now that would be highlighting that the price changes that you\u2019ve made?Walter Robb: Well, that\u2019s exactly what we did do when we launched that. Thus we did marketing in every one of those markets to partner with the investment. So we still are doing that and we expect to continue doing that along with whatever the next steps are. We decide to take with respect to our brand campaign which the first phase is kind of wrapped up. So I will say we got a great new Global Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Jeannine D\u2019Addario, happy to have her on the team. She\u2019s brought tremendous years of experience to our group. And so we have a real leader in that area now. And we\u2019re just kind of rediscovering, we\u2019re kind of rediscovering marketing after all these years in the power of communicating what your differences are and what you\u2019re up to.David McGee: Okay, thank you. And good luck.Operator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.Stephen Grambling: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. You had mentioned the need to balance the physical and store experience. And you\u2019ve also been talking about the digital offering. And how is this balancing act being factored into your real-estate strategy with regards to any changes in the size or type of store you\u2019ll be opening going forward?Jim Sud: Yes, this is Jim. As far as store size goes, we\u2019re really focused on store-size of at least 40,000 square feet. We think our sweet-spot is somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 and in most of the markets that we\u2019re currently serving.", "17": " They tend to, all of our stores tend to start-off pretty strong but the bigger stores definitely take longer to reach maturity. We\u2019re building them for the long-term. And we don\u2019t want to cut ourselves short. So we think there is a lot of opportunity with the bigger stores. This quarter I think we - our average store size as we signed was approximately 44,000 square feet. And it\u2019s been running about 38,000 to 39,000 before this. So you can see that it trends towards the bigger stores again.Stephen Grambling: That\u2019s helpful. And then one other follow-up if I may. There is some comments on innovation. I\u2019m just trying to understand how you think about an opportunity to tie Whole Foods brand to the food itself in a bigger way, perhaps where there is opportunities to take private label beyond some of the traditional categories?A.C. Gallo: Hi, this is A.C. Could you give an example of I\u2019m not exactly sure what you\u2019re looking - what you\u2019re asking about?Stephen Grambling: I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand whether there is additional opportunity to leverage Whole Foods as a brand with the food itself, whether that\u2019s in the produce in a bigger way or even in dry grocery if there is still opportunity?A.C. Gallo: Well, we are continuing to work we\u2019ve kind of built up over the last couple of years, our exclusive brands team. It\u2019s a very robust team now. It\u2019s, they just did a great job with some really nice holiday items for us. We\u2019re looking at continuing to grow the products that we have and improve the quality in the grocery department. We have our primary exclusive brand has been our 365 brand which is a little more value oriented but still really good quality. But we started to brand more items now under the Whole Foods brand in grocery. And generally, like for instance in the olive oil category we went to single-sources around the globe and got some really nice olive oils and we market those as a Whole Foods brand versus our Value 365. We\u2019ve also just in the produce department rebranded a lot of salad mixes that we had into mostly into the Whole Foods brand as well.", "18": " We\u2019ll take that question from Jerry Cowens [ph] with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.Jerry Cowens: Hi thanks, this is Jerry. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your gross margin, it looks like you were performing a little bit better than the worse than 30 basis points said last year. I guess you talked about with your comps easing a little bit, especially the next couple of quarters, why that wouldn\u2019t get better? And I guess, what drivers, what are the drivers of that, what expectations do you have built into that gross margin guidance?Walter Robb: We didn\u2019t actually give gross margin guidance I guess we gave some direction about that. I would just kind of point you back to our discussion earlier which is to say our intention is and we\u2019ll continue over a multiyear process to continue to bring the gross margins down in a sequential fashion, through a combination of these efforts around the price investments as we true-up to the marketplace as needed offset by our investments in, our improvements in cost structure and process changes. So kind of what we\u2019re talking about is kind of a sort of a glide path that in the order each year sequentially a little bit more and that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019ve talked about the gross margin. So I think we\u2019ll leave it at that for now.Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the program back over to Walter Robb for any closing comments or additional remarks.Walter Robb: Okay. Thanks everyone for listening in, Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.

We opened three stores including our first store in Huntsville, Alabama; a new flagship store in downtown Los Angeles. For the quarter, comp store sales declined 1.8% against a 4.7% increase in the prior year. In addition to headwinds from a tougher comparison in a highly competitive environment, the negative impact from cannibalization increased for the third consecutive quarter. We continued to be a destination for the holidays with comps for Thanksgiving and Christmas week showing a nice lift over prior run rates. For the first five to -- from the first five to the last 11 weeks of the quarter, traffic in basket trends on both the one and two year basis showed improvement. We stepped up our value offerings to customers primarily through more and deeper promotions such as our customer appreciation, love fest and three-day sale in supplements, which were supported through social media, digital ads and select radio ads. Over the remainder of the year, we plan to continue our promotional strategy including more personalized offers and increase and broaden our price investments as well. Cost savings and SG&A primarily salaries and benefits were more than offset by investments in value and technology as well as deleveraging areas such as occupancy and depreciation resulting in a 58 basis point decline in OM. We produced an 8.3% EBITDA margin, $0.46 in diluted earnings per share, $53 million in free cash flow and 14% adjusted return on invested capital. In keeping with our new, capital allocation strategy, we returned $679 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases ending the quarter with $1.4 billion in total available capital and $1.0 billion in total debt. Last quarter, we outlined our nine point plan to fundamentally of all the business including active steps to improve our price perception and further differentiate and enhance our shopping experience. We are on track with that plan and would like to share some highlights for the progress we are making in several areas. We continue to open innovative retail stores such as our downtown LA store, which broke regional records for opening day and first day sales and -- first week sales and has already established itself as a full service grocery store and culinary destination. Featuring exciting venues such as acclaimed chef, Roy Choi second Chego outpost in our very own Eight Bar offering daily specials brunch as well as signature craft cocktails and beers.", "21": " We welcome Tien Ho as our Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality. Tien has worked with some of the most recognized chefs and hotel brands in the world and we look forward to his leadership in elevating our $3 billion prepared foods and bakery business to even a higher standard. Our exclusive brand sales increased to over $725 million or 15% in total sales, 150 basis point increase over the prior year. Notable product launches over the past year include a collection of body care products for babies, organic Greek yogurt, animal welfare rated organic sliced deli meats and an expanded assortment of seasonal and holiday items. Our insta-card sales continue to grow nicely and we now offer delivery in 16 markets with many stores seeing sales as a percentage of total store in the mid-to-high single digits and several stores averaging baskets over $100. We are in the process of expanding the service to more stores and several new markets this year. Our new labor scheduling program is now active across a majority of our customer sales teams. While still in the early innings, we are pleased with the labor savings we are seeing. We expect to have the program substantially in place across all U.S. customer service teams by the end of Q2 and introduce the program to two additional teams in Q3 We are close to completing the pilot phase of our new point of sale system rollout, which is now being tested in select stores in 10 regions. We expect to complete the pilot phase over the next month after which the rollout will accelerate and we are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers we have accelerated the first component of our national Affinity program. We are excited to announce today the launch of digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market mobile app expanding the functionality beyond recipes and shopping lists. Coupons have been the top request among users and now with a simple scan at the register preloaded digital coupons can automatically be applied to matching items in a shopper's basket. We encourage everyone to download the app today and take advantage of deep discounts on everyday staples like milk, yogurt and granola, seasonal offers like $5 off the dozen Whole Trade Roses just in time for Valentine's Day and more. This is a win for customers, a win for us as well as we will gain actionable customer data on a national scale.", "22": " In addition, we have committed to expanding our Affinity test to a new market in Q3. Our newly designed rewards program builds on the best elements of our initial test but with lower costs. Finally, with 13,365 by Whole Foods Market leases now signed, we are pleased to share the opening schedule for our first stores. We expect to open in Silver Lake, California in late May, Lake Oswego, Oregon in July and Bellevue, Washington in August. We invite you to check out 365 by wfm.com for a taste of what's to come. Turning now to our updated outlook for the year, we are raising our EPS outlook to reflect our slightly better than expected Q1 results. We saw an improvement in traffic trends over the course of Q1 and while we have seen some negative impact from weather events in the first three weeks of Q2, we are hopeful that comps improve going forward as comparisons get easier and our sales building initiatives gain traction. We note that, however, that there could be some offsetting impact from the ramp-up in price investments and promotions through the year. Based on our Q1 results, we now expect a year-over-year decline in operating margin for the fiscal year of up to 70 basis points. Reflecting increased value efforts as the year progresses, the year-over-year decline in gross margin excluding LIFO in Q2 through Q4 is expected to be greater than 86 basis point decline in Q1. We expect our gross margin investment to be partially offset by a sequential increase in SG&A leverage. And excluding $0.02 to $0.05 per share in estimated net accretion related to debt financed buybacks, we expect fiscal year EPS of $1.53 or greater or $1.07 or greater for the remainder of the year. In closing, we are making measurable progress on our strategic plan to fundamentally evolve our business and will continue to do so over the remainder of the year. We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long-term. We will now take questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Vincent Sinisi: Hey, great. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks very much for taking my questions and good start to the year here.", "23": " I know that in the release you put a bit different commentary than you have in the past. Can you just give us maybe a little bit more color in terms of kind of the margin puts and takes, what you've done so far in the first quarter and then you say expected to be a bit greater in the following quarters, kind of how that cadence we can maybe expect that.Walter Robb: Yes, certainly. Let me say first of all thanks for your acknowledgement of the start to the year. So AC, you want to give some detail on that?A.C. Gallo: Sure. In Q1 as we mentioned, we started ramping up our margin investment with more promos. We had the big love fest promo that lasted through much of the quarter. We had a big 365 weekend promo and then a big three day sale in supplements. And we also -- those types of promos we're going to continue. We announced we just launched digital coupons. We're going to be really continuing to increase our promo activity throughout the year. We also started to do additional investments in perimeter departments in Q1 and we plan on continuing that and focusing even more in those as the rest of the year goes on.Vincent Sinisi: Okay.Walter Robb: So wrapping that into the big outlook for the year, just confirming what we're saying is we expect the investment Q2 to Q3, Q3 to continue to be incrementally greater than what we saw in Q1.Vincent Sinisi: Okay. That's helpful, guys. Maybe if I could slide one follow-up quickly here. Just to make sure that we all heard it correctly. In terms of the loyalty program, so in the mobile app digital coupons now available to everyone, in terms of the full scale test rollout, today it's still in the one Philly market. It will be in a second in 3Q. And any further thoughts on when we could see that expand the rest of the way?Walter Robb: We do have thoughts about that but we're not prepared to share those today. But I think what we wanted to let you know is that we've kind of finished the testing as a group. We've kind of evolved to where we'd like to see the new model and we're launching that -- we have the markets selected. It will happen in Q3.", "24": " Gallo: We are going to take it company-wide. So sometime during this year we will announce when it will be company-wide. But we are not prepared to do it today.Ken Meyer: Also, the digital coupon and the app platform is the same as the Affinity program. So it is in essence the same thing. So with more bells and whistles with Affinity as we roll out the second test. So download the app, check it out that's essentially the future.Walter Robb: It's definitely part of the future.Jason Buechel: We really want to get it right before we launch it across the whole company. We think we're very close to that now, so hang in there. We will -- probably next quarter or the quarter after we'll be able to give you something more definitive.Vincent Sinisi: That's very helpful. Best of luck.Walter Robb: Thanks, Vince.Vincent Sinisi: Sure.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee CRT. Please go ahead.Renato Basanta: Hi, this is actually Renato Basanta on the line for Chuck. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. So I guess first, can you just talk a little bit about the decision or sort of the thought process on investments in promotions versus just price reductions, sort of what are the areas of the store you're being more promotional in versus where you're just reducing prices and again how you think about the puts and takes of each tactic as you think about investments over time.Walter Robb: We need both of them and we're going to stay general because of the competitive landscape but AC maybe you could provide some details.A.C. Gallo: Sure. We are doing both. I mean there are certain very important categories that we know that we need to be competitive on an everyday basis on. And so we are -- we're working to systematically identify those and move pricing on those to make sure that we're competitive. There's a fair number of items we've lowered prices on so far this year and have plans to do more as the year goes on. But we've also found that we have always been a kind of -- our company's always had a strong high, low strategy, that's what our customers respond to.", "25": " This is David. I would also say that we're encouraged by activating our customers digitally with some trip driving promotions in the last few months, $0.25 cup of coffee with our friends at Allegro, $0.09 green smoothies, $0.25 cookies. Those are things that get people up off the couch, into the store. And hopefully they'll continue to buy other things when they come in.Renato Basanta: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Was just hoping you could drill down a little bit on your expense cuts. Clearly, you're seeing some nice leverage in SG&A. Can you just give us a better sense of what are the major buckets of expense savings that you're sort of pulling from to you achieve that, specifically if you could just try to quantify or compartmentalize the savings, particularly when it comes to your $300 million savings target that would be pretty helpful?A.C. Gallo: So, first of all, we just want to affirm that we're on track with that target we set out for ourselves. We made good progress. We're where we expected to be. I think that's reflected in the numbers. I don't think we're going to break out the components of that in particular just because in the last quarter we've moved back the SG&A which contains the [SCs] [ph], those are all together. But fair to say that the biggest bucket in there is the labor and benefits. That is the biggest expense in the company and that's where we've gotten significant improvement. So do you want to add anything to that, David or Ken?David Lannon: I would just say that one of the things that we're doing is really looking at where we cannot have less service but have smarter service in our stores and that is the process and also looking at the back of the house, where are areas that we can streamline and create more efficiencies to consistent of practices and develop standard operating practices in our stores.", "26": " Thanks for the question.Renato Basanta: Okay. Thanks.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Chris Mandeville: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. This is actually Chris Mandeville on for Mark. Walter, you mentioned something in regards to cannibalization having worsened for the third consecutive quarter. I think in the past few quarters it had worsened by 20 to 30 basis points or so. Can you speak to the magnitude in this quarter and when you expect things to improve from that standpoint?Glenda Flanagan: Hi, this is Glenda. That was about the same in Q2 as it was -- I mean Q1 as it was in Q4. Q2 ought to be our worst quarter for the -- at least the Chicago cannibalization and as we open most of the Dominic stores in the middle of the year last year and -- but it won't fully -- the Chicago part won't fully go away until the end of Q4.Walter Robb: Yes. We just cycled our first, the Streeterville store just about three weeks ago, I think. So the first of the seven in Chicago.Ken Meyer: And Miami's are going to start getting better this quarter, Q2 right now, so I think we're near the worst of that and by Q3 we'll be seeing noticeable improvements.Chris Mandeville: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the 365 format, really appreciate you laying out some of the timing on the store openings in the pipeline for the leases. But can you speak to the competitive dynamic around actually obtaining the desired locations and how rates have been trending given kind of the low vacancy levels that we've seen of late and maybe just provide some color in regards to the cities that were actually chosen and why that was the case. Thanks.Jim Sud: Well, we're seeing a lot of opportunities for 365 stores just like our Whole Foods stores. And we're also finding that we're able to acquire these stores on very favorable rents, less in general than our Whole Foods Market stores. We have quite a few of our 365 in development in Southern California and but it's just -- it's not necessarily by design.", "27": " But we also have leases in other isolated markets as well.Walter Robb: That was Jim Sud.Chris Mandeville: Thanks, Jim.Walter Robb: Just introduced him.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.Kelly Bania: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Was curious about the digital coupon launch, if you were able to test that in any market, if you have any color you can share on usage or just customer feedback and then how much of the coupons are vendor funded versus funded by Whole Foods.WalterRobb: Well, just -- I will add and then will give to Jason. It's been out a week and I just looked at the usage over the first week and it's as expected a lot of it was in the Philadelphia market where people have already used to using their app when they shop. But the usage is pretty darn encouraging and so Jason, you want to add some more color to that.Jason Buechel: Yes. We did a soft launch on January 28th. We've had new downloads of the app have increased 43%. We hit a high of active users which was a 50% increase since the end of January and I think for us the most exciting part is customers that are registering. We're up 260% folks registering us with the app. So thus far we've gotten lots of favorable reviews and as you might notice if you take a look, we have both supplier funded offers as well as Whole Foods funded offers.Walter Robb: I just wanted to add we also replaced our CRM or e-mail platform and in the last six months we have doubled the number of users, registered users on that platform to be able to -- so we'll be able to reach more customers and to reach them digitally with the messages. So these things are working in constant together.David Lannon: And then Don Clark, our GVP of Non-Perishables is working closely with the supplier community and offering them opportunities to do coupons with us. So it's on our pallet of ways, our suppliers can play with us in this area.Walter Robb: I think she asked how much the suppliers are participating in that. Do you want to answer that or too early days.Jason Buechel: Too early days.Walter Robb: Too early days evolving, yes.", "28": " Thanks for the question.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Ken Goldman: Hi. Question on comps from me. Prior guidance, I think called for around negative 2% in the first quarter, then flat the next two, and then plus 3 in the fourth quarter. You did as expected in 1Q but you've reduced the outlook for the year a little bit. So as you think about the cadence of the rest of the year, is there any quarter in particular you're I guess a bit less or on is that pacing you talked about previously that still generally what you're looking for?Glenda Flanagan: Just to clarify, we didn't guide to those quarterly comps. What we said was if our two-year comps remained stable, then that's what you would see. So but we're not in the business of predicting comps. So -- Walter Robb: On the other hand, we did affirm -- we affirmed our annual guidance of 3% to 5% sales growth. We're continuing to you affirm that today.Ken Goldman: Okay. Maybe I'll follow up after the call on that. One other one from me. Last year at this time you were I guess in the midst of a pretty big advertising push. At the time you were pleased with the ROI in that spend. Really haven't seen at least as far as I can tell the same level of advertising since. And I'm just curious, the reason as simple as you're getting a better return from other investments or is there some other driver behind that? I'm just curious why the campaign didn't really get sustained or at least what I'm seeing.Walter Robb: I think we're -- it's interesting you mentioned that because just this week we started our radio campaign in 12 markets across the country, promoting our produce and our produce price investments and our produce quality. But I think as a group we've kind of gone back and rethought exactly how we want to bring the brand forward and we're starting with your our efforts in promo and price as AC outlined, onto the digital platforms like David and Jason were talking about. And I could see a brand campaign in our future.", "29": " Gallo: What's different and what you're really referring to is that we haven't launched a big national television campaign and that's been a conscious decision on our part. It's not to say we won't do one in the future but we decided we had better priorities or better opportunities or better strategies for trying to promote our new lower prices and we've got our 365 launch and we've got a lot of marketing dollars being spent out there, perhaps not in as visible a way on a national basis.Ken Goldman: Okay. Thanks so much.A.C. Gallo: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Bill Kirk: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. On the quarter to-date trend, how big of an impact did the East Coast snowstorm have? Have you quantified that?Glenda Flanagan: We have not quantified it. It's a difficult thing to do, not quite as scientific as you might think. On one hand, we had 59 full days of lost sales this year versus 26 days last year, which also had some significant weather events. And there was a lot of volatility within the three-week period. We also saw the two-year comps decelerate in the non-weather regions as well as in the weather affected regions. So essentially it's just too short a period of time to draw very many conclusions. We have the trends from before the storms but we don't have much information about trends after the storms, so it's difficult to do. We also had the Super Bowl shift from week to week, although it was within the three weeks so it didn't really affect the year-over-year number, but it did affect our ability to really quantify the impact of the storm. That's why we haven't put a number to it.Bill Kirk: Okay. Thank you. And then, on the guidance, it looks like there's less accretion from the debt funded buybacks than you had last quarter.", "30": " So it's just an update based on actual rates, actual timing of the bond and actual timing of the buyback so far.Bill Kirk: Okay. Thank you for clarifying that for me. That's all.Glenda Flanagan: Sure.Walter Robb: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please go ahead.Meredith Adler: Thank you very much. I was hoping you could talk just a little bit, but you did a great job on expenses, congratulations. Just maybe talk a little bit more about how far along you think you are in terms of some of the efficiency enhancing initiatives you had planned and does that include more centralization?Walter Robb: Well, I think we touched on a couple of them, labor scheduling being one that we outlined in the script that is showing tremendous promise and Ken just spoke a little bit about the efforts around relooking at you how work is done. Do you want to add to that, Ken?Ken Meyer: I would just say that we've really done a lot of work on developing SOPs that we're going to launch throughout the company this year.Walter Robb: Standard operating procedures.Ken Meyer: Standard operating practices which are focusing on a lot of our production teams and high volume teams in our stores. The work around the labor schedule, can't underestimate the power of that technology advancing in terms of matching up our schedule to our customer flow as well as implementing that into the other teams within the store to improve the scheduling relative to the work flow as well. So those two in itself are significant advancements for us in terms of streamlining and advancing the productivity in our stores.A.C. Gallo: I'd also say that our regional presidents have really taken a leadership position on this and are actively working on all aspects of both labor reduction in the store and large reductions in expenses through common buying on packaging and supplies.KenMeyer: Also, one of the things perhaps not fully appreciated is that the 365 stores are going to leapfrog ahead on many of the practices that we will be evolving in Whole Foods Market. We can put them in. There's no culture. There's no legacy there to overcome. So we can go radical on 365 stores and assuming those are going to work as well as we think they do. They will serve to help accelerate transformation within the mother brand, Whole Foods Market.", "31": " So in some ways we think they represent the future for where Whole Foods Market will be evolving. So of course, we're going to encourage people to take a look at those stores when they're open.Walter Robb: I would also add one more bucket, which is, we're also looking across all the functions in Whole Foods Market to see how we can do the work differently, whether it's team member services or marketing or any one of the functional areas we've been doing deep dives on, thinking through how we're doing the work, where the resources are allocated and where savings can be found. As we've said to you last quarter, we're going to just fundamentally look at our business and see how we can evolve it to be -- eliminate redundancies and be more cost effective. And I feel like the whole company has really embraced that effort and we're making progress.Ken Meyer: We really are. A lot of this stuff is not going to be -- it's going to be seen over the next 12 months or so. But Whole Foods Market is undergoing very fundamental transformations and some of that's beginning to show up. You're going to see a lot more of it in the next few quarters.David Lannon: One thing that's also -- this is David. They were encouraged by as many of our new stores are actually opening at the rates that we're eventually moving Whole Foods to in terms of labor and expenses and structure and service is great, hospitality is great and that gives us a lot of encouragement as we move the rest of the stores to the new program.Walter Robb: That might have been the longest answer in a quarterly conference call but there it is.Meredith Adler: That was really helpful. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Stephen Grambling: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I missed this but can you talk about any difference in comp trends among consumers by demographic or even by basket size and as a related follow-up do you have any insight into the type of customers who have signed up for the digital coupon platform so far that you could share?Walter Robb: We have all that information and it's not something we're sharing today.", "32": " So our tools are really sharpening in this regard. And so we do have some insights into that and you'll see us using those as we apply the efforts in the months ahead. But that's all we're going say today.Stephen Grambling: I guess as a related follow-up then if I can sneak it in, do you have any third party data that you can use to actually personalize the offer right out of the gate?Walter Robb: Yes, I mean, we do have some third party partners we work with and we're already personalizing offers in our Affinity test market in Philadelphia and intend to expand that both with the digital offers we have nation wide as well as future programs we're doing with Affinity.Stephen Grambling: Thanks so much. Best of luck.Walter Robb: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.Chuck Cerankosky: Good afternoon everybody. If you could take a look, please, at the quarter just ended and in particular if you look at the holiday period, you how would you comment on how customers were trading up or their spending behavior? Did you see any changes in that? Were they responding more to competitive promotions as well?Walter Robb: Well, we were very excited with the holiday results. Post Thanksgiving week and Christmas week were outstanding. Customers come to us, they trust us with their holidays. Couple of anecdotes, organic turkeys were the ones that sold first, more than just our natural birds. So we're seeing lots of results there. More than a quarter of our stores were in Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas week did over $1 million in sales. So customers really trust us with the holiday. We see customers do trade up and see they trust us with their family meal.Chuck Cerankosky: How would you compare the comps during that holiday period?Walter Robb: Compare them to what, to last year?Chuck Cerankosky: I should say quantify the comps during the holiday period. Were they better than the run rate for the quarter?Walter Robb: Well, we said in that script. We said they were higher than the run rate for the quarter and that's what David just said. But we're not going to break it out in terms of by individual numbers. But you asked for the tone of it, the feel of it.", "33": " It was enthusiastic. Our stores were humming and David gave you some of the numbers. And it set a very nice tone for the holiday season. So overall I think the tone of the quarter is we're moving forward. We're making progress step by step. I think that's the tone of the quarter.Chuck Cerankosky: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Rupesh Parikh: Congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my question. So the first question I wanted to ask just on you new stores you commented in the script that you're seeing positive performance out of your LA location. If you look at your openings the last few quarters, how are they performing aggregate versus your expectations? And then, you also mentioned earlier that you are seeing better cost structures with those stores. Just wanted to get a sense of with you're still on track to meet your hurdles for store openings.Walter Robb: Yes. I think we are. I just looked at that comparison of the store group in Q1 versus Q1 last year and there's good sequential improvement in both store contribution and sales per square foot. And we highlighted LA store, but there's others performing very well. So overall, good incremental improvement this year from last year. You guys want to add any color to that or -- David Lannon: New Vancouver store also opened this past quarter which actually this quarter which is excellent kind of expands our footprint of Vancouver, really got some exciting new stores. We're finally able to [re-LOE] [ph] our very small Saint Paul store. We're really excited. That opens this quarter. Central St. Louis also opens this quarter.Walter Robb: Awesome location.David Lannon: We've got some great new opens.Ken Meyer: It's Ken here. We just opened our [indiscernible] Spring store. It's our third store in the Orlando market and it's very exciting opening part of our whole new design and experience in our stores. The turnout and the results of the sales were higher than our expectations. So we're really pleased with building that market in Orlando.Walter Robb: And we all just came back from Miami, right.", "34": " It is an absolutely exciting store. We've got a great partnership with fresh there, incredible raw juice provider. We also have a great partnership with Zach the Baker who is a legend in the Miami market and the overall experience in that store is really, really exciting, especially around lunchtime. You can barely move in the store.Glenda Flanagan: If we go, we shouldn't go to the parking garage too.Ken Meyer: The art work is amazing.Jim Sud: And we're really proud to entrust the first 365 store opening with our Southern California region. They're on a roll with [indiscernible] downtown LA. They're also opening next week and then Irvine and then finally 365 in May.Walter Robb: I just think both those stores, downtown Miami and downtown LA, where I was -- it just I think demonstrates again that we're continuing to evolve as a company and providing best ins class retail experience.David Lannon: One of the things that you can expect to see going forward particularly as Whole Foods Market is in this transformational shift is you're going to see the Whole Foods Market stores, they're going to be larger stores. They're going to have a lot of innovation in them. There's going to be a lot of prepared foods. There's going to be a lot of exciting things about those stores. That's why when you talk about downtown Miami or downtown LA, we're talking about fairly large stores that are really exciting, fun stores to be in. With the 365 stores opening now, they're going to take the smaller footprint, be very curated product mix, very focused on creating value for customers, a convenient, quick shopping experience. So over the long run you won't see small Whole Foods Market stores open up. That's going to be the purview of the 365. It's going to give 365 stores can go into a lot of markets we think Whole Foods can't go in with these bigger more exciting boxes. We're going to work for the Whole Foods Market Stores to be very differentiated with a much more exciting experience than our competitors bring.", "35": " We think we've got lots of growth room for both concepts and we're particularly excited to get those 365 stores open because I think people are going to take a very different perception of our company.Walter Robb: As you pointed out the Whole Foods Market is going to be influenced by 365 and vice versa by the way. And so what comes out of that we don't know yet.David Lannon: We're excited about our future. We think we've got a good strategy. We're excited about our -- the nine point plan we outlined last quarter. We feel like we're executing against that. We're happy about the progress we're making. We feel we're on track and that's going to be demonstrated I think pretty clearly over the next several quarters.Walter Robb: So again, we're happy with the new stores.Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great.Walter Robb: To answer the question, yes.Rupesh Parikh: Thank you for all the color. I'll stop there.Walter Robb: I hope you got that out of that answer.Rupesh Parikh: I did. Thank you.Walter Robb: All right. Go to them. Go see them.Rupesh Parikh: I'll go visit both of them.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Robbie Ohmes with Bank of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.Marisa Sullivan: Hi. This is actually Marisa Sullivan on for Robbie Ohmes. Just want to get a sense of inflation and deflation trends that you saw during the quarter and what you've seen to-date in the forecast?A.C. Gallo: Hi. It's AC. In Q1, we saw an inflation of around 1%. Few things were up. Our meat costs were up slightly. Our produce costs were down slightly. But overall, about 1% which is lower than it's been. Looking forward to the rest of this year, we're estimating somewhere between 1% and 2% inflation. There's -- some of the pressure that was on inflation this past couple years with the droughts in California seems to be easing a bit. It's been raining out there. There's good snow pack in the mountains. We've already seen prices of certain commodities like almonds and cashews coming down.", "36": " And then just quickly on the competitive environment, are you seeing anything different from your competitors regarding promotions or price investments?Walter Robb: There's lots of them and everybody's active right now. It's a very evolving marketplace. We feel good about our tools of tracking all that and we're getting a lot more aggressive ourselves with both promos and price investment. So it's a dust-up.Marisa Sullivan: All right. Thank you so much.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Siegel with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.Mark Siegel: Hi, thanks for the question. Just further drilling down on the theme of price here. Understanding that investment and promotion are both part of the plan going forward. Can you talk about how you think about the relative weighting? It sounds like the kind of preference leans toward more targeted promotion. And then just as a follow-up on an earlier question around centralized procurement or move towards more centralized procure machine, can you talk about efforts around center of the store versus the perimeter. Are those efforts unfolding together in lock step or does perhaps the center of the store occur first and the perimeter follow? Thanks.Walter Robb: Why don't you take that second part of the question, AC, on the -- A.C. Gallo: Sure. As I said earlier, our focus in Q1 and going forward this year is largely in the perimeter departments. In center store, we're in the process right now you with our new global device President of Non-Perishables, Don Clark, of developing a category management strategy beyond what we've done here in the past and through that strategy we're going to be identifying, looking carefully at all the different categories in center store and deciding where specifically strategically we want to do price investments, promotions, things like that and we'll be doing those in very close cooperation with our suppliers. So we see that as something that will be -- we're going to be testing this year and it will be an emerging -- it will be emerging for you as the year goes on and into next year.Walter Robb: I just want to add, just remind that we don't define the competitive challenge as just a pricing challenge. We also define it much more broadly with efforts to expand our digital platforms, our reach to our customers, our marketing message all those things where we can communicate our differences and our quality.", "37": " It appears we are ending our time for questions. We'll take our final question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Andrew Wolf: Good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in. AC, so I guess you guys have a little inflation as I'm sure you know the conventional side of the business has a lot of deflation, particularly in meat. You have a little inflation. They're down probably double-digit. Is that kind of -- is that limiting, or do you expect it to limit in any way your guys' ability to pass through some of this inflation, with the conventional world deflating and I know there is some sort of spreads that I think in the past you've talked about sort of trying to maintain.A.C. Gallo: Let's get an example. Like for instance, in beef, there's been -- the conventional, commercial meat market has seen deflation. We're not seeing it a as much because the unique antibiotic-free meat that we sell and organic meat we sell are pretty locked in with contracts to ensure supply. So over the course of the year, we'll see some of that ease down, but what we think is when you've got a differentiated product you have a certain -- it's going to sell -- you can sell it at a different price than the conventional market. I agree with you, there's a certain relationship that needs to happen, but what we see there, we see the same thing in organic dairy. We see the same thing in organic produce that the demand is high in those categories and so there isn't the kind of deflation in those categories that there is in some of the conventional product categories. So everybody is -- everybody's paying a similar -- everybody's affected by that. And so we don't see where we sell so much organic product that there's really deflation in there. So it's not really affecting our ability to be competitive in large categories of what we -- of where we do business.Andrew Wolf: And just one more follow-on. I don't know, Glenda, if you -- I think you mentioned that the non-weather impacted markets also had a little slowing in the two-year stack.Glenda Flanagan: Yes, in the three weeks. It's one of our toughest comparisons.", "38": " I'm just wondering what it would with be for the non-weather impacted markets.Glenda Flanagan: No, I'm just -- I just wanted to make the point that we saw it in the non-weather regions as well as in the weather regions. So as an example of why it's not as easy to quantify the impact of the weather as you might think.A.C. Gallo: Three weeks is such a short period of time.Glenda Flanagan: It's very hard to draw a conclusion.A.C. Gallo: -- conclusions without much data. So we're trying to -- Glenda Flanagan: What we will say is what we saw in the two year comp trends for the last 11 weeks of the quarter was very stable.Andrew Wolf: Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.Walter Robb: Okay. Thanks everybody for listening in. We hope you'll download the app and schedule a trip to downtown LA or Miami. We look forward to updating on our progress on our Q2 earnings in May. And the transcript of the scripted portion of this call along with the recording of the call is available on our Web site as well. Thanks very much.

I will now turn the call over to John Mackey.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have announced today, we are setting a new strategic direction for Whole Foods Market in order to deliver improved performance and higher returns over the long-term. While our nine-point plan is still very much intact, we are resetting and refining our growth strategy and moving faster in fully implementing category management, which is such an integral part of our go-forward merchandising, pricing, marketing, and affinity strategies. Over the past 38 years, Whole Foods Market has played a leadership role in fresh, healthy, natural, and organic foods becoming mainstream. Now that we have, we must revisit the question of how to best serve all of our stakeholders. What has become clear is that we don't want to compete in a race to the bottom as consumers have ever-increasing choices for how much and where they shop. Through our affinity work, we know that our core customers represent our largest customer segment and account for a majority of our sales. They are dedicated to the high-quality, fresh, healthy foods, and transparency that we offer. While they are already highly engaged with our brand, there is still significant opportunity for growth. And if these customers add just one more item per trip, the sales potential is significantly greater than with any other segment. Going forward, Whole Foods Market will focus on serving this growing niche of customers better than ever before. This is a win-win, as delighting our most committed and informed customers, our Whole Foodies, results in a better experience for all of our shoppers. We see tremendous opportunities in applying this new, targeted approach to all aspects of our business, from marketing to merchandising to real estate. Examples of some steps we are already taking include our recently-launched Eat Real Food brand campaign, the acceleration of our category management initiative, and the resetting of our growth strategy. We kicked off the new year with our Eat Real Food brand campaign, which targets our core customers with its Eating Well and Living Well theme. While the campaign has been on air for just a short time, we're pleased with early indicators that show positive trends on ad recall and purchase intent, and we look forward to establishing an ongoing customer dialogue through our new, always-on paid media plan.", "41": " Evolving our purchasing operating model while developing data-rich, customer-centric category management capabilities are critical steps \u2013 steps that are integral to our go-forward merchandising, pricing, marketing, and affinity strategies, particularly with regard to supplier support. dunnhumby has a proven track record of using data-driven, customer-led insights to create relevant shopping experiences for customers on a market-to-market basis, and this strategic partnership will help us go faster, do more, and do it better. We do not have specifics to share on timing today, but we do expect our shorter pilot phase and roll-out timeline to meaningfully accelerate the sales and margin benefits. We will continue to grow, but no longer have a goal of 1,200-plus stores. We remain optimistic about the future growth potential for our 365 format but want to see how this next round of stores perform before getting more aggressive. As we work to position Whole Foods Market for long-term success, we have carefully evaluated our portfolio of stores and have made the difficult but prudent decision to close nine stores in the second quarter. We believe our targeted and disciplined site selection and continued moderation in ending square footage growth will result in a healthier bottom line, increased free cash flow and higher returns as we minimize the negative impact from cannibalization and redirect our energy and capital on improving comps, EBITDA, and ROIC. I will now turn to our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales increased 2% to a record $5 billion. In what continues to be a challenging sales environment, we maintained our expense disciplines, delivering 7.6% EBITDA margin and $0.39 in earnings per share and $284 million in operating cash flow. In keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we invested $245 million in capital expenditures and returned $43 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion of total debt and $1.2 billion in total available capital. We have seen stability in our comps over the last three quarters with some modest traffic improvement from Q4 to Q1. During the quarter, we saw wide swings in comps on a weekly basis, as is frequently the case in Q1 due to weather and holiday shifts. After a strong start for the first five weeks, comps dropped off sharply in the pre-and post-election weeks and then showed nice lifts over Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks.", "42": " Many stores broke weekly sales records, and more than 100 stores surpassed the $1 million mark during each of those holiday weeks. We welcomed 13 new stores in the quarter, including two relocations in Philadelphia and Winter Park, Florida. In Philadelphia, we relocated a 20-year-old 37,000 square foot store to a new 63,000 square foot location with a food hall that can seat 140 customers. In addition, customers can enjoy lunch or an evening out in four fast-casual dining venues run by favorite local chefs; the Parkway Pub or the Parkway Perch upstairs, which offers a spectacular view of the Philly skyline. And in Winter Park, after being part of the community for 18 years, we were excited to provide our customers with a new store that is nearly twice the size, has more parking and includes exciting new culinary offerings such as self-service Japanese mochi ice cream bites and sushi burritos. In markets where our brand is well-established, relocating older, smaller stores to larger locations offering more parking and an elevated shopping experience offers low risk and high returns. We expect three more relocations this year with another 12 in our pipeline and we'll continue to seek additional opportunities. Over the last two years, we have moderated our lease signings, ending square footage growth, and capital expenditures as a percent of sales. We have terminated four leases in development to-date and are continually evaluating our pipeline. We're also continually evaluating stores on a case-by-case basis, balancing the age, size and performance trends of the store with the potential returns from additional capital investments, monitoring lease renewals, and taking into account how each store fits into our longer-term strategy for that particular market. As a result of our evaluation, today we announced plans to close nine stores in Q2. In keeping with our ongoing efforts to increase efficiencies and better leverage our size and scale, we're also closing our last three remaining commissary kitchens. These closures were all prudent, but difficult decisions. And we are working closely with all affected team members to find other positions within our company. Turning now to our thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. We have updated our outlook, primarily to reflect year-to-date sales and comp trends, lost sales related to store closures, and $14 million of estimated costs related to accelerating category management.", "43": " Please see our press release for more detailed information. We are pleased comps have shown stability over the last three quarters and are hopeful they will improve as our always-on brand messaging and other sales-building initiatives gain traction and comparisons get easier. Our two-year comps have continued to moderate, however, and while it has only been three weeks, we have seen further moderation in the second quarter-to-date. Given the competitive landscape continues to be very dynamic and it is uncertain how long a deflationary environment will continue, we believe it is appropriate to reset comp expectations at this time. Please note Easter was in the second quarter last year and will fall in the third quarter this year, negatively impacting comps in Q2 and positively impacting comps in Q3. Historically, the impact has been approximately 50 basis points. We covered a lot of ground today but before we turn it over for questions, I want to say I have never felt more energized and inspired to lead Whole Foods Market and strongly believe that refocusing our efforts on how to best serve our core customers, while pursuing a more targeted and disciplined growth strategy, will result in improved comps and healthier bottom line and increased free cash flow and higher returns. We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you. Operator?Operator: Your first question comes the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was just curious \u2013 and thank you for all the information in the press release and in the script, it is helpful \u2013 just curious if you could provide an update on the affinity card program. Maybe how it's doing versus your expectations. I know there's some optimism there and I know you don't generally comment on how particular stores or regions are doing but just generally are you happy with how the comps are performing in the areas where the affinity card is more developed? Can you update us on maybe the potential for that? Just maybe give us a little more possible tailwind factor going forward.Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. This is Jason. I'll comment.", "44": " We're seeing very healthy baskets over 2x of what we see for non-members, and we're increasing the percentage of sales. We're in the process right now of planning a migration of our Philly program to the program we have in Dallas. One of the things that John mentioned earlier was connecting this to category management, which we feel is a really important step. When we look at how we'll plan our promotions, offers, and the relationships with our suppliers in the future, a key part of our affinity program is going to be bringing those pieces together in a very unified way. So we plan to put together an additional test here. We'll be bringing those together and then bringing that to market with our customers. And we're very excited with some of the work that we're already mobilizing in that space.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then just a quick follow up. Is it fair to say that \u2013 and if you can't answer this, I completely understand, but I'll go fishing anyway \u2013 is it fair to say that comps in those areas, Dallas and Philly, are maybe better than the corporate average at this point or is it too early to say?Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: We don't actually provide comps at a metro level at all, so I'm sorry. Your fishing expedition probably did not work there.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'll go fishing somewhere else. Thank you.Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Thanks.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about the decision to close the nine stores? I presume these are all stores that are underperforming, but is there any color you can provide about specific stores and perhaps the metrics that you looked at when making the decision? And as we look forward and as you evaluate your stores on an ongoing basis, have you considered changing the format of any of these stores to 365 rather than simply closing?John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: John here. We looked at a lot of different factors. We're constantly evaluating our store base as well as our pipeline.", "45": " So we went ahead and instead of investing more capital, we just decided to close up shop. So there were a lot of factors we look at. Of course, we think closing these stores will help our profitability, increase our EBITDA, increase our comps, so they were all \u2013 all the stores were \u2013 we made after actually quite a bit of discussion and thinking it through, and we think they're the right stores to close at this time. Looking forward, we don't anticipate that we're \u2013 that there are going to be a bunch of more stores we're going to close. I mean, I think we recorded last time the company does not have that many stores that have negative EBITDA and even fewer that have negative EBITDAR. So I think we've cleaned up the stores that we needed to clean up for the time being, and we're looking forward to moving forward. Regarding 365, of course, we are \u2013 some of those stores were too small to even be a 365 store. So we, over time, as we get into 365, the next group of stores is going to open in 2017, and if those stores do as well as we think they will, then that could be a formula that we will apply to some older stores that we might, instead of closing down or convert to 365. And the case, we didn't think any of these stores qualified to be converted.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: David, you want to add anything on the 365?David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: That's good.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, John.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, hi, guys. Good afternoon. Can we just \u2013 I want to go back to store growth and just how we should really be thinking about the go-forward strategies around store growth. I think I heard you say that you're going to be moderating growth a lot. How do we sort of think about that? Are you essentially kind of stopping growth at this point, at least until you get a better sense of the how 365 is doing?", "46": " First, this does not mean we're stopping growth. First of all, we've got 80-some-odd stores in our pipeline at this point, so we've got a number of stores that are queued up to open. So we're going to continue to move through those stores. We're probably going to moderate the number of future lease signings that you see. We are \u2013 part of the reset that Whole Foods is talking about today is that we're going to continue to grow, but we're going to be, I think, a more disciplined growth company than we've been in the past. We are going to focus a little bit less on growth and a lot more on getting our comps increasing and getting \u2013 and focused on increasing our EBITDA, our returns on invested capital, and our free cash flow. And we don't have any numbers to give you, but, obviously, as our growth slows down a little bit in terms of the number of stores that we're opening, we expect our free cash flow to go up; we expect our EBITDA to go up. We expect our \u2013 since new stores do not produce in the short first few years as much as more mature stores do, so we do expect that's going to have a positive impact on our comps, our EBITDA, percentages, free cash flow, et cetera. In terms of what to do about investing that money, well, we still have a \u2013 we have a couple of years of stores in our pipeline we've got to work through, so there's not going to be any significant changes for the next couple of years. And by the time we are starting to really pile up free cash flow higher than what we've been producing, we'll have a better answer for you on that question.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Thank you.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. So I had a question on the quarter-to-date comp trends, if you can provide any more color in terms of what you think is contributing to that moderation in the basket size?", "47": " It's Glenda. What we show in the \u2013 we do think there was some impact from weather in that period of time which impacted both the transaction count and the items per basket. But it's such a short period of time that we really don't want to draw any major conclusions from it.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yeah, I don't know if people picked up in the press release, but we are not \u2013 this will be the last time we give partial week comps.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Partial quarter.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Partial quarter comps in our press release going forward because we find people overreact on the positive or negative side of that, and it's such a short time period. Weather and holiday changes and closings, they so affect a weekly comp that people draw too many conclusions from it, so.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, and also, we've just seen that it's not indicative, as you saw in the last quarter in Q1. It's not indicative. Frequently, it's not indicative of what we see for the full quarter, so we've decided not to report it on an ongoing basis.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to start, on the nine store closures, is there any sort of common theme there that you would call out? Is it lower income markets or maybe competitive markets? Anything \u2013 any commonalities that we can think about?John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, I feel like we sort of already addressed that question. There's a number of factors that went into the decision-making to close those nine stores. Some of the stores \u2013 a majority of the stores were older stores that we had acquired that were small stores that simply, in a more competitive market, weren't competitive. In many cases, they had negative EBITDA, and a few had negative EBITDAR.", "48": " And in some cases, the stores were just simply in markets that we had too many stores already existing, so we thinned out the market a little bit to improve our comps and improve our overall profitability in that market. So it's hard to generalize about it. Each one of them was a strategic decision, and kind of each closure stands on its own as a right decision for the company.David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: This is David. I would add in addition, though. In many cases, we do have larger, higher volume stores close by, so we expect to see a transfer in sales for many of these locations, as well as we're really looking for a lot of the team members to transfer from those stores to some of the newer, more modern Whole Foods.Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then, just one in terms of SG&A leverage. You called out wages leveraging 42 basis points, and as we think about the mechanics behind that, it seems to imply kind of wages per store are down pretty meaningfully. Can you talk about where that's coming from? How you're harvesting it, and whether you feel like there's any sort of risk to the in-store experience? Obviously you've got quite an edge in service and the experience side of things.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, we actually have worked very diligently to, what we call, smart service at Whole Foods Market, asking, where does the customer want us to provide service, and where do they not want us to provide service? In many cases \u2013 I mean, a trivial example is, traditionally, we've done pizza in our prepared foods has been a service department. But we found when we go to self-service, that sales go up meaningfully. I mean, in many cases the sales go up 100%. And that is true in bakery, it's partially true in meat and seafood, so we're just sort of thinking through our business model and doing lots of experiments in terms of where we can reduce labor costs that do not affect or negatively impact the customer. So a lot of those labor cost reductions have just been about us reorganizing our stores in a more intelligent ways.", "49": " We're basically examining every aspect of our retail operations and asking what are we doing here that's not creating value? That's just adding unnecessary cost. And so that's what you're really seeing as we work our way through that, and I think you'll see that over time. We'll see increased efficiencies gained as we go to automatic replenishment, which we're pioneering at some of our stores right now. As order-to-shelf is rolled out through the whole company, as category management gets into place, there's just a lot of initiatives that we are operating on right now that we think will reduce our operating expenses. At the same time, we're also making investments. We are investing more money in marketing than we've ever really invested before. We are accelerating our category management, and so we've given guidance today. That's going to increase our short-term costs, but it's going to produce, we think, meaningful gains for our investors over time. David, do you want to add some color?David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, one-story I'd really point out, especially since a lot of you folks are in New York, is to go check on our new Bryant Park store, where we have order kiosks where customers can order and pay for their lunch and we have a very, very efficient way to get out things like sandwiches and burritos and items like that. And in our first week, on the average hour, we were achieving four times the amount of orders on the kiosk than any other store we've ever had. So this is a technology that we're putting in place in all of our stores. And again, it's faster for customers, so they appreciate it, but we also have the additional benefit of needing less labor in the store when we do things like that.Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Awesome. That's really helpful. Thanks guys. Good luck.Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good evening. Just actually a bit of a follow up to the previous question. I noticed that the inventory per store was down about 9%. John, is that a reflection of the category management efforts that you discussed?", "50": " The biggest thing with that inventory reduction is through the process of our order-to-shelf project led by Bart Beilman and his team, and that has transformed the inventory levels that we have in the back room, essentially clearing them out so that we're mainly focusing on, what we call, our never-outs, the key items that we need to have in stock all the time in our stores. And so that reduction isn't really showing up on the sales floor on the shelf as much as it's showing up in clearing out the back rooms of inventory that's not necessary. So it's creating a really strong, efficient process from the way the goods are received in the back door to bring them right out to the shelf. And it's really improving and helping our out of stocks, as well, dramatically.Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I assume that's also helping with shrink as well?Ken Meyer - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Absolutely, absolutely. Because what happens in our perishable departments when we reduce the inventory in the back room, it's handled less and it's, essentially, when you take away the handling, it improves the reduction in shrink in the stores.David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Anecdotally, in the stores where we really fully put in order-to-shelf, we're actually looking at some very empty back room spaces and coolers so we've actually started to contemplate with new store design how much \u2013 we actually need less room in the back of the house than we did traditionally at Whole Foods Market.Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is open.Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. This is actually Marisa Sullivan on for Robby Ohmes. I just want to touch on the basket size changes quarter-to-date. To what extent \u2013 and maybe some color on Q1 as well \u2013 to what extent are you seeing your promotions and price investments driving the change in basket size? And to what extent, particularly in this quarter-to-date, is deflation a factor?A.C.", "51": " We think that that has come from some of the work we've done over the past, especially over the past year with certain price investments in key categories, such as in produce. And so \u2013 now, that's been going along with a relatively \u2013 we've seen a really flat cost and retail increases. We saw a little deflation towards the end of last year, and that's pretty much moderated for us. We're seeing pretty flat quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year in our costs and in our retail prices.Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good afternoon, everyone. John, could you reflect on the range of organic, natural, and related merchandise, such as non-GMO, that's in many other food retail locations that you compete with and how it affects your pricing and marketing and traffic, et cetera?John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Could you try to \u2013 I'm not \u2013 that's such a broad question. Is there a way to \u2013 are you just saying how we're doing with the competition that's picking up more natural and organic foods? Is that the thrust of your question, Chuck?Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Well, not only that, but also the fact that it's marketed as being better for you just because it might be free from an ingredient. You're up against retailers sometimes that aren't nearly as organic or natural as your stores but they still have enough organic merchandise and free-from stuff to maybe attract customers.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Okay. Maybe this is an opportunity to just reflect on the larger competitive trends that we see in the marketplace. I mean, for the longest time, we always just see the Whole Foods as kind of this \u2013 is a niche player. Pretty much, we were ignored for most of our history. Nobody paid any attention to us.", "52": " And then I think they began to pay more attention to Whole Foods Market and they began to pick up more of our products. They began to study it in a more systematic fashion, and particularly as they began to see their customers begin to migrate over to doing more and more shopping with Whole Foods Market. So what it means for us is that in a lot of ways, the more conventional mainstream supermarkets have upped their game. They've picked up more of their products. And that has slowed the erosion of some of their business that was heading towards Whole Foods Market. One of the things that we've noticed, for example \u2013 and it's also given people a good enough alternative in some cases. So one of the things we've noticed, for example, is that many of our stores where people used to drive long distances on the weekends and do big shops, we're seeing a little bit of a decline on that. We're not getting as much \u2013 some of our comp deceleration has been particularly on the weekends. We're not getting as many people coming in on the weekends buying as bigger baskets. And we conclude that's partly because the competitive alternatives mean people aren't coming to us as frequently as they did previously. But the thing is, is that we still see that our core customer, the Whole Foodie customer, the person that's really, really dedicated to Whole Foods Market, they are still coming to us. And so, part of what our strategy here is, is to \u2013 we're going to double down on focusing on our best customers. We are going to create more value for them than we've ever created for them. We're doing a lot of marketing research just like the conventional supermarkets are trying their very best to keep their customers from eroding to Whole Foods Market. We're going to do the best job that we can to keep our core customers from migrating back over to those guys. So that's kind of our strategy. We're refocusing on our very best customers and that means we're decelerating our growth. We are focused on data through category management, through managing our company a lot more with data and marketing information. And so I do think the world is very different today than it was five years ago.", "53": " That's appreciated.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about the decision to accelerate the category management. And if you could talk about what you have done \u2013 what categories you have done? What kind of results you've seen so far with that effort? And I guess I'm just wondering with the dunnhumby announcement, does it make sense to wait until you have some more informed data or insights before accelerating that program?A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. A.C. here. We have done, as we've mentioned before, we've done one test so far in the category management in a couple of regions, in one of the categories. And have been very pleased with the results. We are building up right now to do a second test this summer in another category, and what we saw from our first results and with the potential of what we've been able to do, we felt like the amount of time it was going to take to go through all the testing phase and then start rolling it out to all the other regions, it was just going to take too long for the benefits that we really believe are there. So we made the decision to speed this up, and the reason that we are very excited and wanted to start working \u2013 create this partnership with dunnhumby is that we feel they give us the tools to not only go faster, but to be much more \u2013 go a lot deeper and be a lot more effective in the type of category management that we're going to be able to do. The tools they have and the experience they have allows us to gain much better insights into what we're doing, and to be able to take that to other markets much faster because the experience they have in doing that, we'll have to do a lot less testing this way and be able to implement a lot faster. So we're really excited about it, and we're \u2013 it's kind of got us really energized and really excited about what we're going to be able to do and be able to have it happen a lot faster than it was going to take before.Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's helpful.", "54": " As you kind of refocus on this core customer, and you outlined that strategy, I was just curious if you could talk about where you stand on kind of price investments? It seems like maybe it's pulled back a little bit in the last couple of quarters. I mean, how do you think longer term about price investments?A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, we have, as we've talked about over the last couple of years, we've made some significant price investments, and going into this year, we've made a few \u2013 we're making a few strategic ones. We've got a lot more strategic this year about where we're investing based on markets. We felt like the investments we've made up to this point are having some \u2013 are working well and we wanted to \u2013 as we looked into getting into category management, we realized that the best results we're going to have is through the category management process in terms of future investments because they'll be a lot smarter investments. They'll be targeted a lot better into specific markets, into specific categories. So we are not right at this point investing \u2013 we did not increase right now a lot more investing over what we've currently done in the last year or so, but we're looking really to integrate it into our category management rollout as we move into that through the next period of time.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: We really want those investments that we make \u2013 we are going to make more price investments at Whole Foods. We're not going to be in this race to the bottom. We're not trying to be the cheapest, but we're going to be very strategic about it. We know it needs to be data-driven, and we think it really needs to be combined with our category management in order to produce the most value for our customers and for our investors. So one of the reasons we want to accelerate category management is because we want to accelerate our price investments, but we want to do it in a more strategic and efficient way than say we've done so far.Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk from RBC Capital Markets.", "55": " Can maybe explain the differences between what Nielsen can do for you and what dunnhumby can do? And did it require one POS system being in place for them to really get started or for them to get started?Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: This is Jason. I can help comment on a few things. I'll start with the point-of-sale piece. There's a lot of improvements that we now have because we have sort of one way of bringing in sales data, which is helping us in partnerships both on the Nielsen and the dunnhumby side of things. For Nielsen, it's really for us to be able to better understand the market share of where we take up and really do a deeper dive into the category as it relates to our competition and the rest of the marketplace. For dunnhumby, we're really leveraging them as resources and tools to accelerate category management. So they're going to be bringing experts that will be working side by side with our team. They're bringing capabilities that are going to allow us to move faster and quicker through some of those processes, and we'll continue to leverage the insights from Nielsen as part of this process as well.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's it for me.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. So this one's probably for A.C. On deflation, and obviously keeping in mind that you guys have a pretty clear quality differential versus what most offer, was there anything notable this quarter versus the prior period? And can you actually help us quantify that? And I guess kind of moving a little bit forward here, there's been a little bit of conflicting remarks as it relates to organic produce and what pricing has been for that specific category. So I'm curious of what you're seeing there as well as kind of the conventional offering counterpart? And what your expectations are going forward?A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. Well, I would say, yes, we did see some deflation in Q1 in produce, in certain organic produce categories, like organic apples were a lot less expensive this year. They were a great item to promote.", "56": " And then certain organic vegetable commodities have also been lower because of a little oversupply from California. There's been other things, though, that have balanced that out. Avocados were a lot more expensive this year versus last year because of some supply issues out of Mexico. Right now, citrus prices are up because of all the rain in California. So \u2013 but I would say that, yes, there was some deflation in produce cost in the quarter. The other area that we saw some deflation was in the price for our beef. We do contract over a really long period of time with suppliers to grow to our specific quality standards. Sometimes our costs don't react as fast as the rest of the market. The conventional beef market really started dropping two years ago, and specifically really a lot last year. And ours came down more slowly than that, but we're definitely seeing lower beef costs. That has resulted in our lowering some of our beef retails and doing a lot more promotions during the first quarter. We balanced that with some \u2013 in seafood, probably our highest volume item is our farm-raised seafood. We sell a lot of it. And there was a shortage in Q1 worldwide. And it resulted in significantly higher costs there. And in that particular case, we absorbed those costs because we didn't want to raise our retails because we think it's a temporary situation that the price of the farm-raised salmon will come down later in the year. When we look at balance through all the departments, as I said earlier, our costs overall were relatively flat. We saw a little deflation in some areas; we saw pickup in some others. And our retail prices were relatively flat. As we said last quarter, there's certain commodities, like eggs, conventional eggs, which the bottom dropped out of last year and it's been huge deflation in that. We haven't \u2013 we don't see that same deflation because the eggs that we sell all have to be raised to our specific standard. They're under contract. We pay our growers based on their cost of production. So that is \u2013 some of those areas stay relatively flat for us when the conventional market really drops out.Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: That's helpful. And then sorry, if I could just sneak one follow up in there as it relates to just generally avocados and produce.", "57": " Given kind of the more moderated gross margin erosion that's been observed in Q1, should we be reading into that, that you're maybe seeing some actual benefits as it relates to certain items that you're sourcing? Or given the competitive dynamic within the industry, are you actually being forced to give that away?A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, we don't \u2013 I know there's been some speculation as to how much actual produce in Mexico we sell. It's really not that high as a percentage of our overall sales. And again, a lot of the products that we sell are contracted. We right now get a lot of our Whole Trade peppers we're getting from Mexico and those are under long-term contracts. So while we see a fluctuation, to some degree, when these things happen, it's fairly steady for us. So I don't think that it really has affected any of our numbers significantly during the quarter or will be going forward.Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.Karen Short - Barclays Capital: Hi. Thanks. So I just had a question. John, you made a comment about doubling down on your core customer and obviously you talked about metrics in terms of getting one more item in your core customer's basket. So I guess the question I have is, does your core customer actually even care about price? Like at the end of the day, does it matter? And do you actually need to invest in price if the reality is, is that you really just need to get greater basket with your core customer? So I'm wondering if you could talk about that. Then I guess the second question would be, is that kind of the way to read your strategy going forward, especially with the help of dunnhumby that the focus will be \u2013 like 80/20 rule on the core customer? And maybe you just shouldn't necessarily need to draw the Millennials lower price points.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, you have to be price relevant, and nobody wants to feel like they're being cheated. And so Whole Foods \u2013 does Whole Foods need to be the cheapest or least expensive retailer out there? No.", "58": " So we are very conscious of pricing and, in some cases, when we have particularly a strong quality advantage, the gap might be a little larger. But if they're selling the exact same items and exactly the same brands, we feel like we really need to be competitive on those prices. Again, this is a big part of what a data-driven category management program's going to tell us: where we need to be; where we need to win; where we need to be really price competitive; where we need to have the biggest selection and other areas where we don't need to necessarily win or be the best but we just need to be competitive. So there's a whole strategy. We have to think through every item, drive it through data and make the decisions. So I think we're in a \u2013 Whole Foods is in a very good position versus most other grocery stores that we can because of our brand and because of our quality differential, we are in a place that over the long-term, we should be able to generate superior gross margins, superior EBITDA percentages, and superior returns on invested capital. But we have to manage our expenses better, and we need to do a better job of closing a gap in certain categories where we're too expensive. And that's why we want to accelerate all of this so that we can optimize our competitive position and maximize our long-term shareholders value.Karen Short - Barclays Capital: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow up, can you give us a sense of maybe when you actually started working with dunnhumby? Because obviously a lot of us on the call know when it \u2013 the time lag of starting to work when Kroger started to work with dunnhumby and when that actually drove comps, I'm assuming the time lag will be much narrower now with you, but any sense of when we should start to think about when it will have an impact?Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: This is Jason. We've just begun the relationship with them. But as we mentioned earlier, our key focus here is accelerating so we've \u2013 they've hit the ground running and we have a lot of things in motion right now.Karen Short - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thanks.Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.", "59": " Thanks very much for getting me in here. I appreciate it. My one question just back on the store growth but particularly for the 365, locations, I know you said you're opening three On Tap now for this year. I just wondered if you could all give us on the line a sense of what are the learnings that you've been going through since it's been a little bit of a pause period here. What's working, what's not working? And maybe any thoughts on kind of in relation and effects on your core stores as well, as you prepare to open the next few here? That would be great. Thank you.David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. This is David. I'll try to be helpful. We don't talk about the results of any individual stores, but what John talked about earlier we are taking the go slow to go fast strategy with the 365 stores. We actually built in an eight-month deposit after the first three stores. So it's in the DNA Whole Foods to really innovate. So I think the next generation you're going to see in Austin, Santa Monica, and Akron, Ohio, you're going to see a lot of improvements. So we're learning a lot. The thing is that a lot of the elements that we're talking about putting in Whole Foods are in place at the 365 store. We have full category management. We have electronic shelf tags. We have auto replenishment. We have a great affinity loyalty program. So we're learning those lessons in the smaller environment that are applying to the bigger environment. And then some of the things are working really well and some of the things we need to improve on. So some of the areas \u2013 one area I would say is customers definitely want a little bit wider product mix, so again, we're using the data that we have because it's completely category managed to add additional items. So, for example, like bulk, we've added some additional bulk items, we've added some additional vitamin body care items and we're making adjustments as we go. So I really encourage folks end of April to come down to see Austin, the fourth 365 that opens there.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: The Cedar Park store outside of Austin is going to be kind of 365 2.0.", "60": " And then of course \u2013 and David, when is \u2013 I think Santa Monica next? When will that store open?David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yeah. Santa Monica and then Akron. So...John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yeah. And we expect that to open in the \u2013 so Santa Monica should open in the summer. And, of course, that's a great location. We think that store is going to be a huge success for us. So I think you'll like what we're doing. I just reviewed the 365 2.0 strategy and the look and feel of it, and the additions that we're making to it and got pretty excited.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.", "62": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of 2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the \u2013 in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase. Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits like Prime Video.", "63": " And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119 for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price of Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentioned this last quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is \u2013 the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is \u2013 would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex-FX year-over-year. Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period.", "64": " So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities, what can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime \u2013 those markets using Prime Now.", "65": " Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So first, with the \u2013 you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're \u2013 we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last two quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for \u2013 see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip.", "66": " We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research: Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised \u2013 or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. But again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on the question on capacity, \u2013 excuse me, cap \u2013 I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses.", "67": " That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products. That's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at play there that hopefully keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top-line growth was \u2013 continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on \u2013 with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially. We \u2013 at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high \u2013 relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers.", "68": " So that also helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So \u2013 and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what was that? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are \u2013 what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, high margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow \u2013 that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway.", "69": " We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with \u2013 on investments. It's also \u2013 there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase. So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys.", "70": " And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically?Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes.Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in \u2013 who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Yeah, thank you.", "71": " First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a little bit about dependency there? And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales \u2013 taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the UK. It helps with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1. So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing really more to add on that.", "72": " We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to slow? And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned earlier, creation \u2013 or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from...Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sorry go ahead.Operator: Sorry go ahead. Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex-Whole Foods and ex-AWS looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in the international markets would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years?", "73": " Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America. So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection and great customer experience. So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices. And sorry, I cut out the last person [Technical Difficulty] (30:50-30:55) including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over time Amazon products better. We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, to 40,000 [Technical Difficulty] (31:46-31:51). Yes, but it's \u2013 it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thanks Brian.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. You're now live.Mark Mahaney: Okay. Hey, I'm going to ask two questions, because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric, just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk to us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%, I know last - ex-FX. I know last quarter you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate, how do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India? Thanks a lot.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'd start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And then, also it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. So your question was on international growth. Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance and very, very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you'll remember with the timing of the Diwali holiday. But we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in India.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan.", "76": " I'll also ask two, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the confidence in that. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high-end of the revenue range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue. So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us.", "77": " And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. We've already started down this path. We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve. And we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve this offer. And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees. And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year.Doug Anmuth: Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: And that - sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. And we expect - we built the Q2 range about - around what we've seen.Operator: Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. You are now live.Justin Post: Great. Thank you. As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before.", "78": " Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share - I wouldn't share with you today the Prime - any Prime - specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say.Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. You're now live.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful. Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding - reporting for businesses and advertisers, so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now about tools and making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon demand-side platform, things like that, operational improvements. And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have.", "79": " So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon. And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. You're now live.Stephen Ju: I'm sure you can share in regards to the Prime users' awareness of the availability of stuff from Whole Foods. Is the order flow coming in from a wide number of users? Or is the activity coming in from a small, but very dedicated number of customers? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our online stores classification. So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of the - or the recognition of the Prime benefits by - at Whole Foods, and also the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017.Operator: Thank you.", "80": " You're now live.Daniel Salmon: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe, Brian, just to return to the advertising business for a moment. It does sound like, as Eric noted, that there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this way. Do you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large numbers? And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker. I would imagine, it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure, we're understanding that quickly that - this investment rolled out relatively quickly and starts to take effect relatively quickly.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery. So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay tuned, because we'll be building this - most of this capacity through the year in 2019. And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say, we're early on in this venture. There's a lot of - it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also authors. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.Operator: Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.", "81": " A couple of questions. In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate in the third-party marketplace business? And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versus films or TV content? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Let's step back on the third-party question. So again, let me reiterate our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party. We actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform, it's because it adds selection. It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection. We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country. So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses.Dave Fildes: Yeah.", "82": " It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very popular, critically acclaimed shows have obviously come out, things like Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some great titles. So I think look for us to continue to invest there. There was - on the accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in January that amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net impact for the first quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year.Operator: Our next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company. You're now live.John Blackledge: Great. Thanks. Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year? And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery. As the one-day program starts, how many SKUs will be available? And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for one-day at some point? And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with Whole Foods. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. So, yes, on the one-day free shipping versus the two-day free shipping, our goal is to evolve the two-day free shipping program into a one-day free shipping program and we're making strides on that. It got into a little bit about the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year. We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side. We feel we're doing something very important for the customer.", "83": " And we'll just have to see what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that one-day category.Dave Fildes: And then, this is Dave again. Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the selection there for the two-hour or even one-hour delivery capabilities. And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean\u2013 and in other initiatives as well, where we can get food through Pantry, Go, there's a number of initiatives there. So excited about what we'll be able to continue to bring to customers on that space.Operator: Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. You're now live.Ben Schachter: So more on the one-day shipping. Should we expect that to rely mostly on USPS, UPS or other shipping services or you're really going to try to build out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure, Ben. I would say, we're going to be using all of the available levers that we have right now, both AMZL and also third-party carriers, and we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners. So outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for future quarters at that time. I would like to - as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask a question for myself about AWS, because I want to get some information to you. Most of the questions I can tell around one-day are topical and important. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1.", "84": " The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business. We're continuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time. We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates.Operator: Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. You're now live.Mark May: Thank you. And actually a follow-on to AWS, the growth clearly impressive, but we did see, I think sequentially, and I apologize I'm not in front of model, but I think the growth was somewhere at 3%, 4% sequentially. There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. Just wondered if there's anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could call out, that may have contributed to that. And apologize, but another one-day shipping question here. In terms of the $800 million, just curious where that gets you to, in terms of coverage of zip codes and SKUs? I assume right now this is a project that's in the US. And where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that you expect to be a near- to medium-term priority in some of your other developed markets like the UK, Germany, et cetera? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that. So, Mark, it's - let me start with that second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are seeing in Q2 is starting in North America. But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program.", "85": " I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that, mainly because we are still again working through that. And while we have ratcheted up a significant - we turned the dial significantly in April. And so we'll see the cost impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter. I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on all of our orders quite frankly. On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year. This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. So there are differences in sales cycles. There are differences in adoption of the cloud. There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX-neutral basis and again a $30 billion - greater than $30 billion annualized run rate.Operator: Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. You are now live.Heath Terry: Great, thanks. I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever. And you guys have said in the past that generally CapEx sort of tracks your - that you're investing at the level of growth that you expect. I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So just trying to understand sort of where the disconnect is there, and to the extent that your - the level of investment in physical infrastructures says anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to read that is?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for that question, Heath.", "86": " I would point you back again to the investments that we made in 2016 and 2017. So we did front-load a lot of the investment both in fulfillment centers and also infrastructure. But more than that, it's more than kind of leading through excess capacity. We have some really, really impressive gains and efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. We talk efficiency. And every percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of dollars. So again, that's a big part of our model. It is not only investing, but also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for customers. And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through new rates or new deals that we have. So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously. Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through the year. And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. Although, we did just launched our Hong Kong region today as well and I want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there. And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So it continues to be a really good story for us.Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I'll go to a new topic, one-day shipping. So Amazon, the first principle is customer obsession. And, Brian, you talked about record Prime sub-growth last year. I guess the question is what are the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in one-day? Are there certain types of users, demographics of users, categories of products, countries you think this will help you attract and retain? It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see as the big opportunity to invest in one-day?", "87": " Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Great. Yeah, Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and convenience, which is the mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to one-day, it increases the convenience and it increases the available selection into the consideration set. Although, we have many items that are available in one to two hours, and also same day, the vast majority of our selection is available to you in two days. If we get that to one-day, we literally cut it in half, that's tough math for you. I'm sorry to do that. But the - we think that that will open up a lot of potential purchases that - and it will open up convenience to those customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats as you know, two-day, one-day, same-day, two-hour, stores, there's all types of - points of being there for the customer, when they need us at different points in their consideration set. So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers. And we're very excited to add this capability. And, again, part of this is we have the capability, because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine-tune it. But I thank you for your question.Dave Fildes: Yeah, Brian, and this is Dave. Just briefly on healthcare, I mean, that term can touch upon any number of different parts of our businesses. Of course, we've talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other companies, including the healthcare industry and providing them some great selection. And fast delivery is part of that - the business program there. So - and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst other verticals there that they serve. PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition closed, and continuing to support them in their mission and learn from them certainly. So no real update on that, but excited about the potential there to be sure. Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.", "88": " Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2020 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO, Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you. It includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. Including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "89": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our business services and therefore, our actual results to differ materially from our guidance. And now I will turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past two months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it has also been a time of heroic action by healthcare workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time. I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen at Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand. Particularly for household staples and other essential products, across categories such as health, and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network. And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels, while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining six foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network. In our Whole Foods stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers, and reserve special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund, and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy.", "90": " Our network pivoted to shipping priority products within one to four days and extending promises on non-priority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores, with more than half of our units sold or from third-party sellers. We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60%, and expanded in store pickup at Whole Foods stores from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers and the overall effort to fight the COVID virus. AWS has created data lake to assist healthcare workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example. Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels. How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID related costs in Q1, and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp up of new employees. Investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, our wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs, as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for non-essential items.", "91": " We take this responsibility seriously and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time. With that, let's open up for questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Douglas Anmuth: First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in Q2 and whether over time does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Doug, first on testing. So, we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we needed to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to - and to again, we'll see how we do that differently and I don't know, you know again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is, is getting testing in the hands of our employees and then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people cost, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I am only - we\u2019re only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months. And we'll continue to update this, but for now, most of what we see are temporary cost in the scheme of things, but certainly very expensive temporary costs. And also ones that we're not sure how long they'll last.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "92": " The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? And any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far in the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current [indiscernible] you've been going through?Brian Olsavsky: Well, I think we've learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or a Prime Day then it is to be ready for something like this when everything hits at once. High demand and also a need to restock automatically and prepare for it. So that's not something that we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for, and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers. On the Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, you're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits. So in March, for the first time viewers nearly doubled, which is I think a good time for people to when they're, a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained. And you'll see our video collection. It's also beyond kind of Prime Video. It's also our channels and video rentals also went up, as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw that as well. I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using people using Alexa calling and drop in.", "93": " I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they are handling the additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney: First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies? The way you track it pre-COVID, Amazon was able to, had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand with within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand, and where you are in terms of the recovery? In other words, when are you going to be - how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that? And then the second one was, could you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected maybe the growth rates were really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate? What are you seeing there in terms of, I assume there is much greater usage of AWS now? Is that something that would show up in the P&L, maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1on such a large base, again, we're, now it's $41 billion run rate, and that's 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing post-COVID is, it varies by industry. I think what is probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers, there's millions of active customers from start-ups, to enterprises, to public sector. So there's a lot of variance. And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly.", "94": " So right now where we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job at that, I believe. On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we have seen and levels of one day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations. We had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from one to four days, and then further on non-essential items. I had restrict things that were coming into the warehouses, and focus on the essential products. So we think that is still was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of non-essential items and the speeding up of one-day shipments. I will explain a bit on the one-day shipping cost, because it's aligned with this. So we originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on one-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's - in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to ship things two-day, three-day, four-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment. But most of our one-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for one-day shipping. Things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day. So those are actually coming in, all those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have. And we're glad we've made that investment, but we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers. So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock, picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly.", "95": " So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will, when we do that we'll see a resumption of more one-day service. But, right now things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry: I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call they had mentioned that they had seen two years worth of digital transformation in the cloud in two months. I'm curious if you, how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this has meant for AWS, and the rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly? And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter. If we adjust for that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter over quarter. Any sense of, or any sense that you can sort of share with us just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the one-day investments in the efficiencies that you're seeing there, versus anything else in particular that you would that you would call out?Brian Olsavsky: Yes, so first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments. You may have heard us talk about digital transformation. I think what I would say is, we've continue to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage not only in the United States but globally. Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the most functionality, largest vibrant community of customers and partners having really proven operational and security experience. And building what customers need in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and other really key areas has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet. And yes, we are seeing different performance in different industries. But our sales force is still there to help, help not only with current capacity, but also the transition to new, as people make that journey onto to the cloud. And then expand their use of the cloud.", "96": " I think the question is perhaps if how do we have a range that's above zero, if we have $4 billion of cost? Is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there is - there are some efficiencies that would leverage that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes. There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are - you get more capability both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have, again, very much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that are still out of stock. So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to, we believe we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in, I would say in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost. So there's a lot of moving parts here, but certainly the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant. On the one-day, I would remind you that the one-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past four quarters. And then the other thing that I would just point out is the - remember the impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS business that was a $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1. And that will continue into the rest of the year. And that that again is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, it's a hardware and a software challenge. And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets, or recognized that we have been extending the life.", "97": " Keep in mind.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Maybe two, if I can. One, on the demand of the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter in place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus in U.S. or Asia in the U.S. or India, in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? Be curious for what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19. And one quick one on the cost side of the equation, the cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. Wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in the overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time. Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Sorry, Eric, I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly we would look to see lower shipping costs. Although I would, but a lot of, I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition, the airplanes. There's things that we do on long haul trucking, and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. But we haven't quantified that, not for our guidance. I can't break it out for you right now. On how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say in the types of products that people are buying in the state home restrictions. So it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries, on one certain countries and when it's maybe ones where they are in their curve, and flattening the curve and all that. I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India, where of course, we similar to other companies in India, we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering, and we will further expand when the Indian government announces that were allowed to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern except for grocery in India. And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts.", "98": " French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also different experience than the other countries internationally.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post: A couple, just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in consumer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their subscribe and save, anything you see that could really signal a longer-term change in consumer habits, faster adoption of certain categories. And the second thing for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis? Thank you.Dave Fildes: Justin, it's David. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I certainly point to grocery. If you look at the remainder of the online grocery is up in our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a number of ways for customers to do that. Prime Now, Fresh and then of course Whole Foods online for delivery or pick up. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand so, that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible. We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up. Whole Foods stores that offer pick up capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150, so a lot of work being done there. On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there. It increased year-over-year at about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience, rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's again similar, saw lot of folks that were a stay at home measures were not yet in place where shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores. Since that time more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some.", "99": " A lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy, and able to accommodate customers make sure customers are comfortable, however they choose to shop.Brian Olsavsky: And I'd add to that. Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people customer to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through - music, video, Alexa, certainly communication features on our devices. We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with the Prime membership.Justin Post: And then, second half of the quarter, are you assuming, kind of, we go back to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration?Dave Fildes: Well we are heavily constrained, again it's an odd quarter because generally the biggest uncertainty we have this customer demand, and with the order and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong, the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that is the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find non-essential items, increasing marketing, and everything else. So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. And top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers. But usually things you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, yes, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted, and in this quarter, you can't. That's really where the uncertainty is driven.Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.Stephen Ju: So, Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number jumps around a little bit, but is this primarily a matter of constrained delivery resources? And, I guess, the heightened demand?", "100": " Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks, talk about testing, but that's not something that we sell. So there are a lot of supply chain concerns are mostly in those areas right now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me what you just\u2026Stephen Ju: The third-party unit mix de-indexing a little bit as a percentage of total this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just normal fluctuations, or are you just prioritizing the first-party delivery against what's probably limited resources on the heightened demand.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period, because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything. It's we're prioritizing essential items, and a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area tend to be retail supplied items from vendors. So I would say that is the reason that FBA would have not have been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouse as well. Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important and we're very grateful to our third-party sellers. They've been through a lot as well.Operator: Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.John Blackledge: On advertising, the other revenue growth line accelerated. Could you just discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any color on how it's trending in the second quarter if possible.", "101": " Thanks.Dave Fildes: Yes, sure. Let me start that second one, I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce as we change thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now we've fully hired 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April. On advertising what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. On your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account, the majority is revenue. But there's other, some other things, but I can tell you underneath that is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and positive impact it's had on customer selection. But we did start to see some impact. Yes. In March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price, but how but advertising continues to advertise at a high cliff. It wasn't as noticeable maybe as with what some others are seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing. But I think we have a the large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well. And it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising, or are their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value. It has in the past.Brian Olsavsky: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.", "102": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2021 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 29, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "103": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to Q&A, I will touch upon a few highlights from the first quarter of the year. Let me start by highlighting the momentum we are seeing in AWS. In the first quarter, AWS revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. During COVID, we've seen many enterprises decide that they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure. They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery. There's significant momentum around the world, including broad and deep engagement across major industries. For example, last quarter, we announced new commitments and migrations from some of the world's most renowned sports leagues, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, Formula 1 and the German Bundesliga. We continue to expand our AWS infrastructure footprint to support the strong growth we're seeing. AWS offers 80 availability zones across 25 geographic regions around the world. And we've announced plans to launch 15 more availability zones in five more regions. Turning to the consumer business, we continue to see strong customer demand globally in the first quarter. Revenue growth in our international segment grew 50% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in Q1 as restrictive regional and national lockdowns were in place throughout the quarter, particularly in the UK and Europe. In North America, revenue growth of 39%, largely reflects the continuation of demand trends that we have seen since the early months of the pandemic. Third-party sellers were largely comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, continue to see strong sales and serve more customers. Our 3P seller services revenue increased 60% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in the first quarter, growing significantly faster than online stores revenue. Third-party units represented 55% of our total paid units in Q1, up from 52% in Q1 of last year.", "104": " These trends have also extended to Prime's digital benefits. Over the past 12 months, Prime Video streaming hours were up over 70% year-over-year. Amazon Studio had its best award season yet, and Prime members can look forward to a strong slate of upcoming original series and films featuring an impressive group of diverse talent and creators. We're also continuing to expand our roster of live sports content, and we're excited to partner with the NFL and be the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football into the next decade. Twitch is also seeing great momentum. Hours watched on Twitch nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter, and we now average more than 35 million daily visitors. Another popular benefit of Prime membership is Prime Day, and we are excited to announce that we will hold the two-day savings event during the second quarter. Prime Day is also a great opportunity for our selling partners to reach more customers, and will make supporting small businesses a big focus again this year. We'll have more to share on Prime Day, including the event dates a bit later this quarter. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees. In the U.S., Amazon has held on-site vaccination events in 29 states, reaching more than 300,000 frontline employees and contractors. We are watching events closely in Europe and in particular, India, where we have put in place employee initiatives, from medical health lines, teleconsulting, hotel rooms for quarantining and financial support, as well as donating 100 ICU ventilator units to local hospitals. We'll continue to invest in the health and safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our global fulfillment and logistics operations. And finally, to summarize our financial results. Total revenue of $108.5 billion came in above the guidance range of $100 billion to $106 billion. In addition to our strong segment results, advertising revenue within the North America and international segments also accelerated during the quarter. The leverage we are seeing on this higher revenue, combined with strong operational performance led to higher operating income as well. Operating income of $8.9 billion in Q1 was above our guidance range of $3 billion to $6.5 billion. We incurred a little less than the $2 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs that we had projected in the first quarter.", "105": " Looking ahead, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs in the second quarter. Lastly, I'd like to congratulate and thank our employees for making Amazon #1 in the U.S. on LinkedIn's 2021 top companies ranking, an annual list identifying the most sought-after places to work. We appreciate the customer obsession and passion for innovation from teams across the company to make Amazon a great place to work. With that, let's move on to Q&A. Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler: Great. Thanks, Brian. A question on last-mile delivery. So you guys are investing pretty aggressively to build out that Amazon control last-mile fulfillment. We see the blue vans driving around everywhere in the Bay Area, so congrats on that. So I guess the question is, how long until you feel like if that's in the right place as far as all your major metros where you want to set that up. And at what stage, does the unit cost of shipping start to improve from these initiatives? And I guess, high level, is controlling the last mile allowing you to further penetrate or gain market share in certain categories where speedy delivery is of the essence. Can you talk about that, please? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Ross, thanks for your questions. Yes, let me start with last mile in general. So we're investing heavily. We talked about it last year, our fulfillment, including Amazon Logistics investment, we increased our capacity by 50%. And you can see from our CapEx numbers, the CapEx, including infrastructure, of course, increased to 80% in the trailing 12 months over the prior trailing 12 months. So certainly, a large area of investment, not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile where we're putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers, think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations. And then that last mile was just delivery stations, DSP and seeing our delivery service partners as well. So you talked about costs.", "106": " It certainly gets better with demand and amortization and route density, et cetera. But we see, which is very helpful, is the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer. Its churn would -- normally was a batch process where we would hand off a large batch of orders to a third-party once a day, let's say, to a continuous flow process, where we continually have orders leaving our warehouses five, six times a day going through middle mile and then to final delivery, either through our AMZL drivers or DSP partners. So that gives us a lot of ability not only to control the flow of the product, but also flow of information. We're seeing a lot of progress in that area. And I think you'll see it, too, as a customer where you're starting to get more precise estimates of delivery. You'll get notes that say, hey, you're eight stops away from your delivery, et cetera. Because everyone's busy. A big part of delivery is actually being there sometimes when you need to get -- be there for the delivery. Other times, Of course, you can just have it put on your doorstep and get to it later. But that's -- we see a lot of benefit from that. We also see that there's a lot of cutoff times that we can extend, again, because we pretty much have perfect information between the order placement allocation to warehouses where we're going to pick and box up the product and send it on its way. So lots of advantages. We are continuing to invest, and we'll see a large investment in this area through 2021 as well. We do think that it may also spill to 2022. That should set us up in really good stead with our capacity. And already, the majority of our units are going through AMZL today.Dave Fildes: This is David, Ross. Just to add to that, Ryan touched upon it, but there are an important part of this last-mile effort has been the program we've had, the -- Brian called this -- mentioned the delivery services partner program, or the DSP, it's an important part of the last-mile network. And that -- just as a reminder, that employs more than 100,000 drivers, and it's been growing for the past few years.", "107": " So it's a great way for those folks to access the delivery technology and the package volumes we have and tapping on the network. And we've got a lot of really cool elements as part of that program, grant programs to support entrepreneurs and minority groups and really help them build out and helps us support a diverse business community as well.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brent Thill: Good afternoon. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us a backlog number. And there have been a lot of questions about the incredible backlog strength you've seen in the last several quarters, and it finally seems that you're seeing the conversions between that backlog growth and now revenue growth accelerating. If you could just comment a little more on that conversion and how you expect it to trend? Thank you.Dave Fildes: Yes, hey Brent, it's Dave. I think it's -- the backlog growth, just to give you the figures for March 31, it's $52.9 billion. The weighted average life is about where we've been for the past several quarters, so about -- a little over three years in terms of the weighted average remaining life. So that's up about 55% right now. So it really continues to be really strong and really pleased with that. I think that's backlog figures, but also just the revenue growth and the momentum we're seeing in here is a lot of hard work and innovation on the teams and growing teams and reaching out and working with those. And so you can expect to continue to see customers making these long-term commitments. We think it's a representation you think of a lot of companies that have worked with us, been engaged with us, been with us. And as they get better comfort line of sight with what they want to do and as we are able to add even more value and services, it's just a great partnership and a relationship that they want to build with us over those multi-year periods.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.Youssef Squali: Thank you very much. Maybe just a two-part question. First, Brian, you touch upon this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the acceleration in international growth.", "108": " And in, particularly in markets where COVID is no longer a major issue, have you seen any particular declines or maybe just slowdown in e-commerce demand or a decline in growth? It seems like they're going in different directions in Europe, for instance, it seems like the -- a lot of these markets are still very much under lockdown, yet your international business has grown pretty significantly. I don't know if there is positive or negative correlation. Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Thanks, Youssef. Yes, I would say we're seeing strength pretty much across the board in international. And it does vary by country. But if you just step back a minute, on an - even on an FX-neutral basis, we grew 50% in the quarter. We grew 50% last quarter, although that's aided by the fact that Prime Day was in Q4 this year. But if you look at the growth rate prior to COVID and post-COVID, in the international segment, on a -- even on an FX-neutral basis, has been tripling their prior growth rate in revenue anyway. So very strong and probably advancement of the model in a lot of countries by a year or more. And we're really pleased that we've been able to show our value to those customers, not only with our shipments and our ability to deliver and get them what they need to survive in homes in place during the pandemic, but also the strength that we've seen in the digital offering and the adoption of video, music, our devices. So it's really -- and we're forward investing, as you know, in that, in international with a lot of those Prime benefits. So it's really -- it's good to see as the underlying consumer shipping business, part of it grows, that we're still seeing healthy engagement and growing engagement. So I don't have a downside case yet. In fact, surprised a bit by the growth. I don't think we normally would have forecasted 50% growth in Q1. And certainly stressing our operations. But I would -- my hat's off to the operations team, they handled the volumes in Q1 very efficiently. Costs were very much under control. We started to see strong leverage of our fixed assets, especially our fulfillment center and transportation assets.Dave Fildes: And this is Dave.", "109": " But I think along with those efforts in countries we've been in for some period of time. We're continuing to open up new regions. If you look back, Poland recently opened up in March, Sweden opened up in the fourth quarter of last year. And even in some regions that we've been in for a few years, places like Turkey, we launched Prime in the back half of last year. So there's a lot of good effort and thought going into -- by the teams to continue kind of taking what we're learning in each of these geographies and feeding it back into a local presence to take advantage of everything we've learned with Prime and the broader consumer-facing experience.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Ed Yruma: You guys clearly took some market share with delivery and grocery during the pandemic. Just wondering how -- what the consumer behavior has been post -- is it proving to be sticky? And just kind of zooming out, talking about grocery broadly, how the fresh store's performed?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Grocery has been a great revelation during the post-pandemic period here. I think people really value the ability to get home delivery. And we've seen that as numbers go up considerably pre and post-pandemic. So -- but we've also worked very hard to increase our capacity during that time period. In the United States, we're delivering out of our Whole Foods stores, and we've engaged -- we'll be allowed to pick up a greater expansion of pickup at Whole Foods stores. Amazon Fresh became a free Prime benefit, as you know, in the late part of 2019. And customers really adopted it and continue to see strong growth. So I think on the fresh stores, it's a little too early. The stores themselves, we're confident that the Just Walk Out technology that will be a boon, a benefit to customers. And we're very excited about what's in the works, but that's still really early in day 1.Dave Fildes: Yes. And it's -- we've got -- Ed, this is Dave. We've got about 12 fresh stores right now that are open, and we've confirmed.", "110": " So as Brian said, really pleased with the start -- the technology and the feedback from the customers so far.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.John Blackledge: Great. Two questions. The 2Q revenue guide range was strong, despite the initial pandemic comps. Could you just discuss demand levels you're seeing on the e-commerce side, and just other kind of key drivers of strong expected revenue growth in the second quarter. And then on the advertising business, if you can just talk about some of the key drivers of the acceleration. I think it, it feels like it's maybe the third quarter in a row of acceleration. So what's kind of driving that? And how should we think about the trajectory for the business as we round through the year?Brian Olsavsky: Sure, John. Let me start with your second question on advertising. So certainly, traffic has been a large driver of what we're seeing in the advertising space. But it discounts kind of the improvement that we're also seeing, relevancy and new products that the team is, has been rolling out, that the customers also enjoy. So I think the advertising team's done a great job of turning clicks into productive sales, and the advertising that results is valuable to us as well. We're using new deep learning models to show more relevant sponsored products. We continue to improve the relevancy of the ads being shown on the product detail pages. And we've seen rapid adoption of the video creative format for sponsored brands, among other things. So you're seeing a little bit more than just traffic. And again, very pleased with the performance of that team and of the receptiveness of our customers, our vendors, our authors and sellers to our advertising products. We think it's also very valuable for consumers as well, helping them find things more easily and discover new brands. On Q2 guidance, yes, I would say, we are projecting, again, continued strength across all of our segments. We -- I will remind you that Prime Day has been scheduled for later in Q2, and we'll have more on that as the quarter unfolds. So that's a consideration as well.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.Doug Anmuth: Just wanted to follow up there on Prime Day, Brian.", "111": " And then also just on the rationale for timing, given historically in 3Q, we moved to 4Q last year and then now in 2Q. And then hoping you could also just talk about the Thursday Night Football deal, the strategy there, how that drives engagement and strengthens the ecosystem and also what it needs for ad dollars for you.Brian Olsavsky: First on Prime Day, the -- we're not quantifying the size of it. I think there's some pretty good estimates out there that you probably can leverage. But other than to say it's contemplated in this guidance. On the timing, last year, we had intended to hold Prime Day earlier. We -- there are a number of factors, the Olympics, which are still out there this year. In fact, in some -- many areas, July is a big vacation month. So it might be better to have -- for customers, sellers and vendors to experiment with a different time period. We experimented the other way, obviously, in 2020 by moving it into October, but we believe that it might be a better timing later in Q2. So that's what we're testing this year. On Thursday Night Football, I would say just -- I'm not sure I could size the advertising opportunity right now. But we're very excited to have the exclusive content for Thursday Night Football. Of course, we've broadcast Thursday Night Football for a number of years now, shared that responsibility with a lot of other partners. We think we can do some really new and innovative things with that -- with those games, with the NFL, and we're looking forward to kicking that off in earnest.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.Justin Post: Two questions. First on the AWS acceleration, was that at all related to transaction volumes coming back for maybe more cyclical sectors? And could 2Q see even more of that? And then secondly, I think in your release, you talked about 175 million Prime members watching video. It's about 7 of 8 users. So just wondering what you see is the effect on your retail business from that? Any updates you could provide on content spending. And how you think about Prime Video as a driver for overall Amazon.Brian Olsavsky: So let me start on the AWS acceleration. We wouldn't point to any particular customer group.", "112": " To put it little bit in perspective for you, in Q1 of 2019, we were at $31 billion run rate. By last year, we had increased that to $41 billion revenue run rate, which is a 32% increase. This year, we're up to a $54 billion annualized run rate, which is, while also a 32% year-over-year growth, it added $13 billion of revenue in the last 12 months as opposed to $10 billion prior -- $10 billion in the prior 12 months before that. So the percentages can be a little deceiving. I would encourage you to look at the absolute dollar growth, although both were very strong in this quarter. So we are seeing, again, strength across the board. We have firm confidence that we offer a lot of advantages to AWS customers from functionality to a vibrant and robust partner ecosystem. And then really, we also have less downtime and better security, which I think is super important to all of our customers, especially security nowadays. So that's on AWS. On -- Dave, why don't you pick up the...Dave Fildes: Yes. Just in terms of strategy, I think there's probably nothing new or surprising, but just to reiterate it, we look at Prime Video as a component of the broader Prime membership and making sure it's driving adoption and retention as it is. It's a significant acquisition channel in Prime countries. And that we look at it and see that members who watch video have higher free trial conversion rates, higher renewal rates, higher overall engagement. And there's great examples of places like Brazil, where you launch a video-only subscription, for example, that preceded the broader Prime membership with shipping components, and that was, as an example, a great way to expose people to Amazon. And as we launched the broader Prime in Brazil, it was a great mechanism to folks into that program. So a lot of, kind of different experiences there. But as the -- as Jeff's quote would indicate, a lot more people are continuing to enjoy it. And I think the studios team has done a great job, really striving to be the best home for talent, getting a lot of diverse artists and filmmakers and, I think folks are noticing that both critically, but of course, just in terms of viewership, a lot of good momentum there.", "113": " Brian talked about live sports and a lot of the great opportunities that feed into that, too. So a lot of continued excitement there.Operator: Our final question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.Brian Nowak: I have two. Brian, I wanted to ask you one high level one. You guys have done such a great job building out your network and sort of providing consumers with access to so many categories of goods. Give us a couple of examples of areas where you see room for improvement? What areas are you most focused on when you look across all the categories, delivery experience, the countries to invest in and innovate, to really improve the consumer offering? That's one. And then secondly, can you just talk to us about sort of what you've learned about the Echo journey, areas where you've had success, and still existing opportunities for Echo to have a larger installed base and just more of an impact on the ecosystem.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Brian, for your questions. There's always a lot of areas that we're working to improve upon. I think generally, the speed of innovation is very quick at Amazon, but we always want it to be quicker. And we always want it to be globally consistent, and we want to take the best practices from 1 country to make sure we're doing it the same way everywhere. I think currently on our list right now is that we are in the process of getting our 1-day shipment percentages back up to where they were pre-pandemic. We're there in Europe, and we're starting to see in Europe not only strong 1-day, but also more broad, same-day selection, so they tend to go hand-in-hand. In the U.S., we've made improvements or consistently getting better. I would say the end delivery is really a function of everything before it, and how well we can handle and process in a timely manner all the orders in North America. It's been challenged by the volumes, but it's also been challenged by the rapid expansion of space. But we're making progress nonetheless, and we hope to get that even higher in 2021. We're very excited about the adoption of our Prime benefits pretty much across the board, especially with the digital benefits.", "114": " We have some big things on the horizon, including Lord of the Rings, and we're very excited about getting that type of content to our Prime members quicker.Dave Fildes: Yes, Brian. And then just on your question on kind of Echo and if I could take it up a level, really broadly, Alexa and devices. Our goal with that has just been -- continues to be to make customers' lives easier and really more convenient. And we want to continue to bring more hardware choices in that case, but also make Alexa smarter with new features. As we talked about before, advances in AI and machine learning, and really deliver tools that help developers and the makers of those devices build for and with Alexa, because in that community, it's not just our Echo devices, but also a variety of third-party device manufacturers. We've seen a lot of momentum with smart home capabilities and working with them. And so -- and I think with us, with so many other areas, it's about making sure we're maintaining a really high bar, and a lot of that with that type of technology is speech recognition capabilities, the intelligence behind it and getting smarter. And some of that becomes a responsibility that customers have higher and higher expectations for their capabilities, something like Alexa, and that's great. And I think if we just look back over the last 12 months and what's been going on, the role that customer usage has played with Alexa and the behavior there, you've seen, as people have been isolated or unable to be as mobile, you see customers are using Alexa to help them stay connected with loved ones. We're seeing customers using Alexa to help stay healthy. So whether that's interacting with health-related tips or fitness apps or increased usage of the Fire TV, and they're looking to Alexa for information. And so using our devices and the services and the Alexa-enabled services for things like educational apps. And then, of course, part of that, too, is making sure they stay entertained when they're trapped or cooped up and don't have other access. So I think you can just see in that example a lot of really good utility, and it just, I think, encourages our teams to strive even harder to serve customers, given when you see those types of examples and how they resonate with customers.Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.", "115": "", "116": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC.", "117": " It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today's call. I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment. Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the top end of our guidance range of $112 billion to $117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. Our prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter. Throughout the past two years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020. And we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery. We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past three quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. Labor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business. We'll break these into two buckets, externally driven costs, primarily inflation; and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1.", "118": " Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin, and the start of the war in the Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices. For example, the cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates. And the cost of fuel is approximately 1.5 times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. The next bucket of costs related to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network following two years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns and greater stability in our operations. Let's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees that on leave, and we continue to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2. The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage. Despite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business. During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand, but also extended lead times on new capacity. And we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand.", "119": " We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We do expect the effects of these fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of these costs are within our control. And with demand normalizing, we remain focused on rightsizing our cost structure and driving out any cost inefficiencies. Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion. Developers at organizations of all sizes from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Telefonica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the NHL and Thread announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS' millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 local zones in the United States with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local zones extend AWS regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance. Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments. So, let me add to that with our current thinking. First, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, but also supporting our sizable consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. So, think of that as the middle and last-mile capacity related to customer shipments.", "120": " For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, in large part, to support the rapid growth in innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into. So, we've brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear. That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down. Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $7.6 billion, included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. You may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4. We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included the continuation of extraordinary net sales growth in roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries and people started getting out of their homes. In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year, in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. Lastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers.", "121": " Thanks. I want to ask two questions, please. In terms of the revenue guide for the June quarter, I think it sort of implies about 3%. And if you look sequentially and if you look back at the last couple of years, the non-COVID years, the growth has been between 4% and 6%. Are you seeing signs of consumer softness or weakening? Is there any particular factor that would be -- cause your sequential growth to be lower than typical? And then briefly on the margins for Q2. So, you got $4 billion in kind of these incremental costs versus $6 billion in the March quarter, but yet your guidance year-over-year implies kind of the same sort of year-over-year margin decline, about 500 bps. Could you just explain that a little bit? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Hi Mark. How are you doing? On revenue, yes, the revenue guidance we've given is kind of our best view of what we're seeing right now. Customer demand does remain strong. We're seeing, again, continued strength in Prime purchases, Prime commitment, levels of usage, benefits being used, et cetera. And the big part of the year-over-year comp is that we're comping the last part of the very elevated year-over-year step-up that lasted about half of last year's second quarter, and then we move Prime Day to Q3. So, we're not seeing softness. We're cognizant of the current inflationary environment and the impact it has on consumer -- or excuse me, the household budgets, a lot of times that is a time when -- and people come to Amazon because they know we have great prices and selection and convenience. So, it can go one of two ways. But we don't see any macroeconomic factors generally in this forecast on the demand side. We definitely see it on the cost side.Dave Fildes: And Mark, I think your second question was related to the operating income guidance and some of the detail there. So, as Brian said, the first time we've given the guidance for the second quarter.", "122": " So, that will be at some lower levels as we aim to and kind of expect to see some improvement in productivity, some of those other areas. We're also committed to just generally reducing variable cost per unit and working to lever our fixed costs, specifically where we have those controllable cost buckets Brian spoke about. The other thing -- again, Brian mentioned it towards the end there of this opening -- to see that seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense. So, recall that our employees received those RSU grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see the expense of approximately $6 billion. And so, that's up from about $3.3 billion in the first quarter.Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.Justin Post: Big picture, Amazon hasn't really been around during a period of high inflation. How do you think about passing through the higher input costs through pricing? When you look at your units, they're flat and you're just not seeing any price increases in there. I know FX is a headwind, but how do you think about passing that through? And when can we start to see that? And then, second question, it looks like your shipping costs are up 14% versus units flat, probably makes sense with the input costs. But we would expect some savings as you bring a lot of that transportation in-house, a lot of the delivery in-house. Is -- are you seeing savings there? And how do you think about shipping costs versus units? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me make a comment on units first. If we step back, the first year of the pandemic from -- essentially from our world from the middle of May 2020 to May 2021, we saw high growth. We went from a 20% growth rate in revenue to a 40% growth rate almost overnight and held it for a year. And then, we started to lap that for the last year that will essentially end in the middle of this next month. And so, I noted step-downs in the run rate as soon as the middle of May hit last year.", "123": " So, there's a lot of -- you have to look at the unit data with keeping that in mind because there's a mix -- heavy mix issue. But putting all that aside, you asked the question about transportation shipping rates. Our shipping rates are very competitive, and we are seeing savings versus what we would get from external carriers. And it's beyond that. We would not even necessarily have had the capacity to -- from external third-party providers to handle the transportation loads that we've seen in the last couple of years. So, we're really glad that we have our -- as we built our AMZL network, we would not be able to have a one-day program, same day and one-day shipments, if we try to deliver it with third-party shippers. It just would not be cost effective. So, what you're seeing there in the growth in shipping costs versus the unit growth, a little bit on the unit side, but essentially a factor of inflation and productivity that I've mentioned to you on the component that hits in the transportation area.Dave Fildes: Justin, on your second point regarding inflation, of course, we've talked about we're not immune to inflationary pressures on the cost side and with the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the start of the war in the Ukraine since our last quarter. We see larger impacts of inflation, some line haul, shipping rates, fuel shipping supplies and wages, which we talked about in some recent quarters as well. And we also see some volatility in utility pricing for some of the energy costs in operating the AWS data centers. Now, when you look at costs for customers and sellers in terms of product pricing, I just reinforce our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. We aim to offer low competitive pricing and try to stay on top of that pricing environment and make sure we're delivering a great price for customers. For our 1P business, that means continuing to be really competitive in that space with low prices relative to the reputable competitors out there and staying really close to that on the data. For third-party, we don't control that price that's set by third-party sellers. So, they're running their own businesses and we'll adjust the pricing to account for inflationary costs in their environment as well.", "124": " So, wherever we can help them, we do that. We did increase some fees effective, I believe, is today related to the FBA sellers and some surcharge there. We're focused on, of course, addressing permanent costs and ensuring our fees are competitive versus those charged out there by their sellers. But it's still unclear if the inflationary costs will go up or down and so -- and for how long they'll persist. So, rather than a permanent fee change, we implemented that fuel and inflation surcharge for the first time. And it's, of course, a mechanism that's broadly used across the supply chain providers that are out there already, but it's the first time that we've done something like this.Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.Brian Thomas: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Brian, I want to ask you about one day, same day. Now that you're getting inventory selection, SKU selection in some cases back to where it was pre-pandemic. What are you seeing from a demand or an elasticity perspective as you get more inventory available for one day, same day? Is it really leading to incremental sales based on your data? And the second one, I want to ask about tech and content. It came in a little higher despite AWS costs coming in lower. Is there anything else we should sort of be thinking about in our modeling in tech and content, whether it's Kuiper or other items that are moving through that line item for the year?Brian Olsavsky: Let me start with your first question on one day and same day. Yes, we're approaching the service levels that we had pre-pandemic, and that's a positive sign. But this doesn't -- it doesn't turn on a dime, I think as a consumer, I noticed it myself, I see more things in stock. And I -- it opens up the consideration set for things that I may have had to run to a store to get in a short period of time. And that trust and -- as you see more and more of that, you trust it and you continue to order and you then go to Amazon first and say, okay, well, it's maybe my first stop before I even think about going to the store.", "125": " It doesn't take years. It takes hopefully, weeks and months. But we're hopeful and expecting that that will add to good elasticity, the same elasticity is that we start to see prepandemic?Dave Fildes: On the second point, the technology and content. Just as a reminder, components in there is you got the Amazon Tech and the AWS infrastructure, so everything from servers, network and equipment, data center-related depreciation, rent utilities, those types of things. The AWS Tech employee costs and costs to support the dotcom website and a number of other technology initiatives that we're working on. For Q1, it was up about 19% year-over-year, which was down a little bit, less than what you see for year-over-year growth throughout 2021. That growth rate, though, does, of course, include an offset Q1 2022 related to a partial offset, I should say, related to the change in estimated useful lives for servers, which was a little under $1 billion of impact in the first quarter. In terms of just the investment areas, I just reinforced it, it\u2019s continued investment in the tech infrastructure. One of the bigger pieces remains AWS, of course, there. And then, just broadly speaking, inclusive of AWS, the headcount to support -- the build-out and support that the AWS team is doing as well as some consumer tech teams, Alexa and Echo devices and certain other areas there.Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for the question. You talked about how you're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity and, in fact, you're actually running at in excess at the moment. So, hoping you could talk a little bit about how long you think it could take to regain some of the productivity and cost efficiencies in the fulfillment network. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure thing. Well, let me start with productivity. We began and ended the quarter with essentially 1 billion -- excuse me, 1.6 million employees, 1.6 million employees, mostly -- most of them, of course, are in operations. During the quarter, we had a peak of 1.7 million, and we were able to work that down by the end of the quarter.", "126": " But for the most part, our employees are what we call blue badges or permanent Amazon employees. And now, we work on getting productivity up. It's a combination of productivity at the employee level, but it's also a matter of productivity of the -- and harmonization of the network, having the right demand in the right -- excuse me, the right capacity and the right demand matched at the warehouse level and the transportation node level. So, that's what we're working on. And we've made good strides in the last month, and we're -- we see a line of sight to getting back, not all the way to prepandemic rates in the next quarter or two, but a good bit of the way. And that's what we're firmly focused on and working on, and that's in the warehouses and also in transportation. Is there a second half to that question? Okay. Go ahead.Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. And I hope you're both well. Maybe if I could, just sticking on the capacity issues for a minute. In terms of the $4 billion number you're calling out, maybe the first part of the question would be, is that entirely the additional issues that are now front and center versus the issues we talked about from Q4 into first half of '22 from a logistics and supply chain standpoint where we had talked about permanent versus transient cost nature of that $4 billion as you move through the first half of the year? So, is this above and beyond that and above and beyond some of the lingering COVID costs that you had called out in prior periods? Just wanted to unpack some of the stack build of the $4 billion versus thing we already knew before. And then, maybe following up on Doug's question and asking it a little bit differently. When you look out to the back part of the year, not asking for how you might guide. But there's a typical cadence to fulfillment expense build and employee build and headcount build into the back part of the year as you build the capacity towards the holidays. Will that have a very different cadence to it this year because you find yourself with this much excess capacity at Q1, Q2 versus prior years, just so we can keep that front of mind? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure thing.", "127": " Let me start with the cost penalties. So, in Q4, we did mention $4 billion of cost penalties and drag on that quarter. And $1 billion of that was fixed cost deleverage, principally a combination of having enough space and having super high leverage in the prior year when we were chasing volume and had less space. And we indicated that that would be carrying over into 2022 and it has. From a productivity standpoint, our issues in the second half of last year were different. They were -- we didn't have as much labor, even though we added, I believe, was 200 -- I have it right here, 270,000 workers in the second half of last year. We were chasing labor and it was creating much disruption within our network. Long zone shipments, half full trucks, all kinds of negative consequences of not having labor, but we made it through Q4 with the anticipation that we'll be able to hold our labor for Q1 and labor certainty would be a lot better and certain in our network. That is still the plan, and we're probably a couple of months late on that because of some of the issues with Omicron in January. And our reaction to it was that uncertain labor environment where a lot of people were on leave. We hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the Omicron variant subsided rather quickly, at least from our standpoint in warehouses. So, the issue is switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor. And we believe that that will dissipate. It will take time in Q2, but -- so it's not the full -- we don't get the full $2 billion back in Q2, but we will make great strides on that. Inflation has been in both periods. Inflation was in the transportation costs, especially in wage inflation last year. It remains there. It's been amplified a bit by the fuel costs following the Ukraine conflict, which has happened since we last spoke. So, it's more a factor -- those costs will now, we believe, will persist a little longer than we were hoping at the beginning of the year. And I mentioned some of the per unit rates for transportation, cargo shipments and also fuel costs. Those are real, and we have to find ways to offset those or use less of high-cost things, like transportation and fuel. So, we're working on that.", "128": " But what we see is that the fixed cost deleverage will narrow as we go through the year, and we'll be really glad we have this capacity in Q3 when Prime Day hits because that's always a big surge of both, inventory and orders, and then definitely in the holiday season. So, we will -- the way we see it as we've come out of a very tumultuous two years. We are glad we made the decisions we made over the past two years. And now we have a chance to more rightsize our capacity to a more normalized demand pattern. So, what's left there is really inflation, and that's what we're working on and evaluating and finding ways to mitigate and in some cases, having to pass some of the costs through to third-party sellers as well so that we're not subsidizing sales there. And then, we will see. So, we expect the year-over-year revenue comps to improve in the second half of the year because, again, we're passing this year of super high growth that I mentioned before from May of 2020 to May of 2021. But, it's not like the volume has receded. Like, in Q1 literally, where revenue 61% higher over two years from 2020. So the way to think about it is it went up and stayed up and now it's -- it will resume a more normal growth pattern. But I wouldn't be full by the revenue growth rates in this difficult comp period.Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.Ross Sandler: So, the letter mentioned some impacts post the Ukraine invasion. I'm guessing it's mostly on the inflation and the fuel costs just mentioned. But any comment about how revenue trajectory compared in March after the conflict started versus before across your geographies? And is there any noticeable difference between Prime member volume and non-Prime? Thanks a lot.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Hi Ross. No, I would say there's not a lot of Prime versus non-Prime differential. We had what we consider to be a very strong March. It's very hard to compare year-over-year because March last year was the height of some stimulus payments in the United States. But from kind of a sequential period, we thought March was strong.", "129": " So, we're cognizant of that. But what we'll focus on is the customer experience, continue to get our delivery times to be better and increasing selection, which is better than pre-pandemic time period and you're making the customer experience great on a lot of dimensions.Operator: Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Two questions. Just can you talk about advertising a bit? Are you seeing supply chain disruption having any impact on advertising? Just any comments there? And then, second, I don't think AWS backlog was asked. If there's any numbers you can share on AWs backlog growth this quarter versus last quarter. Thanks.Dave Fildes: Yes. Jason, I'll take the second one first, just on the backlog. So, yes, I mean, we're continuing to see what the backlog is, right? It's the increase of AWS customers making long-term commitments for AWS. At the March period ended, we had $88.9 billion balance for that. So, that's up about 68% year-over-year. And the weighted average remaining kind of life term for those is 3.8 years.Brian Olsavsky: And on revenue -- excuse me, advertising revenue was up 25% year-over-year, and that's a strong run rate compared to the revenue growth rate. So, we're still very happy and pleased with the way the advertising team is performing and how advertising has been valued by both, sellers and vendors and others who use it to reach our customer base at the point where they're considering purchases. So, a strong quarter and continue to roll out new and new products for sellers to manage their advertising and increase the ability to analyze and calculate the payback on marketing investments with us.Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest.", "130": " Executives: John Mackey - Co-CEO Walter Robb - Co-CEO A.C.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Cindy McCann. Please go ahead.Cindy McCann: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call are John Mackey and Walter Robb, Co-Chief Executive Officers; A.C. Gallo, President; Glenda Flanagan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Sud, Executive Vice President of Growth & Development; and David Lannon and Ken Meyer, Executive Vice Presidents of Operations. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed today. This may be due to a variety of factors, including the risks outlined in our Company\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-Q and 10-K. Our press release and scripted remarks are available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Mackey.John Mackey: Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon everyone. In Q2, our sales increased 10% to $3.6 billion driven by comps of 3.6% and square footage growth of 11%. We opened 11 new stores, including three relocations and three former Dominick\u2019s locations. There are many moving pieces, so we can\u2019t say definitively what caused the moderation in comps during the quarter. We do know that we are not immune to the larger macro environment, and the exploding demand for natural and organic products has resulted in increased competition from many different channels. In addition, severe weather and cannibalization had a larger impact in Q2 than in Q1.", "131": " A high percentage of our accelerated growth is in existing markets, which is driving market share gains but also producing a drag on comps from higher cannibalization in some cases. We saw this in Austin and Boston last year and we're seeing it in Chicago and Florida now. Keep in mind that our average weekly sales per store are over $720,000, so even when a store gets hit, it is still highly profitable and continues to produce strong returns on invested capital. The store might report slower growth for a year, but after anniversarying the new store opening, it regains momentum quickly. Gross margin, excluding the non-routine supplier credit, declined 12 basis points due primarily to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. While we do our best to estimate the impact of our value efforts, it is more art than science, and customer reactions can vary from our predictions. In addition, strong execution on the buyside helped offset our investments to a greater degree than we had forecast. For the fiscal year, we still expect a greater year-over-year decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, than we saw last year. SG&A improved 29 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits. We are pleased with our continued expense disciplines particularly given comps were light of our expectations. Turning to new stores, for the last eight quarters, our new store class has averaged 36 stores with sales per gross square foot over $700, translating to productivity levels of 80% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than two years old have averaged 16% comps and, most importantly, a 13% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Our EVA-based approach to site selection allows us to consider markets from Olathe, Kansas to New York City. While our expectations for sales productivity and operating expenses vary depending on the type of market and other factors, when balanced with the appropriate level of capital investment, a wide variety of markets can produce healthy returns for our shareholders. We are reaffirming our fiscal year targets. Comps have averaged 2.8% over the last five weeks, up from 2.4% for the last nine weeks of Q2 excluding Easter. We're encouraged by this improvement and are continuing to lean into the changing marketplace, moving forward with our investments in value, marketing, and technology. We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce pricing we have implemented in several markets.", "132": " We continue to believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception. We are continuing our successful Value Matters brand advertising campaign. Beginning next week, this next round will focus on digital marketing, including online video, digital display ads, and mobile and social ads. In Q2, our average weekly Instacart sales increased to $1.5 million, we continued to be the leading Apple Pay retailer with over 3.3 million transactions, and surpassed four million followers on Twitter. Given those metrics, it\u2019s not surprising that in our brand tracking results, digital outperformed with our key demographics. We plan to follow up this fall with an exciting new Values Matter campaign, which will include national television and digital. Now turning to our other news. At our Investor Conference in February, I said we would be making some pretty exciting announcements over the coming months reflecting our ability to learn, grow, and evolve. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of a new, uniquely-branded store concept unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace. Offering our industry-leading standards at value prices, this new format will feature a modern, streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection. It will offer convenient, transparent, and values-oriented experience geared toward millennial shoppers, while appealing to anyone looking for high quality, fresh food at great prices. We are building a team to focus exclusively on this new concept and are already negotiating leases. We plan to begin opening stores next year, and given the more standardized design and product assortment, we expect a fairly rapid expansion from there. Over the past several years, we have explored the idea of new formats several times but never felt the time was right, particularly given our accelerated growth plans. That issue is now behind us, as we have successfully increased our new store openings for six years. In addition, we now have a successful track record of opening some smaller format stores with a lower cost structure. The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness toward fresh, healthy foods by offering the highest quality, broadest selection, and best customer service, and we believe we can still triple the number of Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. At the same time, we also see an opportunity to leverage our long history of retail innovation and extend our reach in the marketplace beyond 1,200 stores.", "133": " This is all we are going to reveal today but we look forward to sharing more details about this exciting new venture sometime before Labor Day. We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central time today to allow more time for questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Vincent Sinisi: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to of course ask just firstly on the sales deceleration later in the quarter, I know you said it's hard to say exactly or try to get gauge exactly what happened, but can you maybe give us a sense for directionally how comps were not only in those heavier cannibalized markets, but also maybe those versus some of the other markets? Was outside of those? Was it pretty consistent or did you see any notable changes?Glenda Flanagan: Hi, this is Glenda. Yes, we did see a broad based decline across many markets in the period from the early on in the quarter to later in the quarter. Most of that being in transaction count and then with the tick up that we have seen in the last five weeks that was in transaction count also. So above the decline and then the uptick now have been in transaction count.John Mackey: Oh, deceleration decline.Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And then the one quick follow-up if I may, realizing that it's early for this new concept, but can you just give us kind of in the order of strategic or a qualitative possession around how you kind of plan the balance back of upcoming concept with of course all the initiatives that you're currently putting into and what you're still early stages in the current stores. Thanks very much.John Mackey: So there is a lot of that question. We're really going to stick to share -- I think this biggest rational of this market place continues to grow and explode and I think we think by creating a second growth vehicle for our company, we can broaden the accessibility of fresh healthy foods and we will continue to be leaders in that sense.", "134": " We're going to have a lot more to share with you before Labor Day. We're going to have a special event where we'll communicate all the details about this in much more particulars at that time, but that's pretty much what we're going to say today.Walter Robb: Yes, no I think a couple things we could maybe emphasize is that we do think this is a very unique concept. It's not like anything else that's out there right now. So we think we're going to come up with a complementary brand and strategy that fits well alongside of Whole Foods Market brand. There are things we can do with the Whole Foods Market brand. We can continue to do a better job on our expense discipline. We can continue to be aggressive in gradually lowering some of our prices, but the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, the best selection, the highest degree of service. So there is -- that brand can bend a little bit, but we can't break it. We're not willing to break it, but we think we can create a complementary brand that can go places, the Whole Foods Market brand cannot effectively go. So we're kind of trying to panelize people a little bit today, but it will be a bigger reveal later on before Labor Day. We will give you the name. We will give you some more details about it. We're very excited about it, but we knew this information is going to leak out because we're negotiating leases and so then if it leaks out, then we're in we ought to deny it. So it's better just to be proactive, get it out there. yes, We're going to open a new concept store, a new brand. It will open it in 2016 and we're about to sign, or are signing leases right now. So the information is out there. That's all we're really going to say about it today. Thanks very much.David Lannon: So I am really excited about the creative team, the creative startup team we\u2019re putting together to work on this new concept, we\u2019re taking some of the sharpest brightest folks at Whole Foods Market and they\u2019re going to working exclusively on this with us and like as John said, it's truly going to be an innovative retail concept.Vincent Sinisi: Okay.", "135": " Please go head.Charles Grom: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just back in February you talked a lot about some of the initiatives you were planning to rollout throughout the year, loyalty, the price efforts the remodels just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the price efforts? Can we dig a little bit deeper into each of those three drivers and I guess, how much are you assuming that your business gets better as we progress throughout 2015 from those efforts? Thanks.Walter Robb: Hi, Charles this is Walter. Yeah, the three buckets we reference to this call basically our pricing, the marketing and the technology along with our stepped up efforts around bringing down our cost structure. So in each of the areas as we referenced today, we're continuing the efforts in produce and within the frame of brining the gross margins down sequentially year-over-year like we talked about. With respect to the marketing, I think we're reaffirming the values matters being successful starting next week. The whole new digital values matter rolls out with social mobile ads, digital ads and I think what you will see this time is a better connection to actually the shopping ask is which is say through, it will connected to instant card that will connected to affinity app will connected to news letter so try to work on the conversion from those ads and so we\u2019re continuing and then this fall will come out with the next version of the TV ads we will add on to what we did on the first time run, with respect to technology the affinity will moving to our next run of markets to summer. We\u2019re continued to be very pleased with that, we\u2019re getting good results, good data points, we\u2019re taking it the next three markets to summer and we\u2019re continuing to -- and growth from that experience and instant card to numbers were in the script but our average sales per week were up 50%, so last time we spoke to, so that continues to roll and so there is a kind of an update on those three buckets and we\u2019re also continuing to work on our cost control as well and we'll have more details on that as the year progresses.Charles Grom: Okay. And just a follow up to the first question, when you do look at the comp, the comp declaration from the first quarter and I think John alluded to being a little bit below your expectations and how do you handicap?", "136": " Was it more competition and I guess, could you quantify either of those buckets for us. Thanks.John Mackey: It's difficult, its John here, it's difficult to quantify it but there is a lot of factors involved as we mentioned there is we have some severe canalization going on right now in Chicago and Florida because of some very success and new stores have opened up there and those markets have taken some big chunk out of those two cities. We know that we are -- we do have more competition than ever before there is no question about that. And finally we\u2019ve got -- we did have some it's a very weird, weird quarter for weather particularly in the North Atlantic region. We had a lot of store closures. So I mean weather is a very difficult thing to predict and sometimes it helps you and sometimes it hurts you on balance hurt us a little bit in Q2. So it's hard to say exactly how that divides up but, I think all three can be considered factors.Charles Grom: Okay. Thank you.Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Ken Goldman: Hey guys thank you for the question. John you mentioned there were a variety of reasons for the comp slowdown, but you weren\u2019t a 100% sure smoking gun was. Is some of the volatility in your comps lately send you to sort of roll out your rewards cards any more quickly or do anything else, to I get to know some of the data behind your customers. You guys gave some great data presentations I thought at your Analyst Day, I\u2019m just wondering, how it makes you o think about it if it all?John Mackey: I mean I think affinity card, yeah that what we call it, I think yeah I think the thing is start to lay the foundation properly and to really make sure we\u2019ve got the technology platform working well. We are irritating daily on this platform and yes, I think we\u2019re constantly talking about the balance between additional investments and the speedy investments and what\u2019s the right pace for those to do that as we look at the total pictures so but I think with respect to affinity, our next step is clear is which is we\u2019re taking now which is some extreme markets that\u2019s going to give us much broader based for understating, how that works, how customers use it.", "137": " Thanks very much.Operator: And the next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please go ahead.Meredith Adler: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I would like to talk a little bit about the new format and it would be interesting to see what it looks like that fact that it's different is hard to invasion, but I\u2019m trying to understand kind of how you see getting to 1200 stores with Whole Foods and then opening some meaningful number of these new stores. Aren\u2019t you going to be either cannibalizing yourself or going after similar markets or and because I guess I've never quite understood how do you get to 1200 stores at Whole Foods.John Mackey: Meredith, again the 1200 stores are Whole Foods. It's not going to be a difficult thing to do at all. We're already 420 and we got 114 in development. So we\u2019re well on our way for that and the thing, one thing to understand is that the market is exploding, I mean it's incredible what\u2019s happening. If you -- one of that's fun to do at Whole Foods is we go back and we do look at what our sales were per store five years ago, eight years ago, 10 years ago. And our sales are so much higher and at the same time, we've been so, so successful that we\u2019d actually brought a lot more competition and everybody jump in kind on the national organic food band wagon and that\u2019s really, frankly do to our success. So I don\u2019t see that there is a problem but what I do think is that the Whole Foods Market brand is very targeted to certain type of customers, certain type of shopper we think the opportunities are lot larger than that and we think there are certain customers at the Whole Foods market brands attractive to but there are other customer that it's less attractive to and we see a whole generation of young people coming up who are quite interested in national organic foods, they're millennial generation, they\u2019re idealistic, they\u2019re values orient, their mission driven, these are all play to Whole Foods Market strength, they\u2019re also very value cautious. So we think a streamlined hip cool technology oriented store unlike any store anybody has ever seen before that has lower capital, lower cost, perhaps little labor cost and lower prices is going to be very, very attractive to that particular generation.", "138": " We\u2019re creating it. It will be new. It will be different. It will be unlike any of the other stores you've seen out there. And hey, sometimes you have to wait to see it, but it will be worth waiting for.Walter Robb: Meredith, this is Walter, I will just continue to add there. We've continued to had a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for Whole Foods Market our flagship brand, maybe we got over 70 stores knocking back a $1 million a week. We have tremendous success and vitality that in this company that continues to grow. And as we open 38, 39, 40 new stores next year we're continuing down that back and it just looks that this new format that we\u2019re developing, that we're going to tell you more about in a few months is going to be a access many more broader markets and communities perhaps that we couldn\u2019t serve with our flagship brand. And so you think about if like you everybody knows this marketplace for fresh healthy foods is getting larger by the day with the different announcements that people are making and this new opportunities -- this new concept that we're developing will allow us to access and participate and contribute and lead in many more markets than -- it just opens up a whole lot new range of opportunity for all of our stakeholders. So that\u2019s the kind of complimentary idea that John talked about early on.Meredith Adler: That\u2019s very helpful and interesting. Can I ask one just sort of housekeeping question? You talked about the -- and adjusted to the employee appreciation event in the last five weeks, does that mean that their actual comp was lower or you\u2019ve already reflected that in the comp that the 2.8 % that you reported?Glenda Flanagan: The 2.8% is the last five weeks which includes Easter in both years. Is that what you're asking me Meredith.Meredith Adler: No, the employee appreciation event, there is\u2026Glenda Flanagan: Yes, what about it?Meredith Adler: Well, is that the number the 2.8 is reflecting.Glenda Flanagan: It excludes in last year, yes.Meredith Adler: Excludes in last year. Okay that\u2019s very helpful. Thank youGlenda Flanagan: Okay.Operator: And our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Rupesh Parikh: Thanks for taking my question.", "139": " So the gross margin performance again was let's say better than expectation this quarter. So as you guys look at the price investments you've been making the past few months versus prior quarters, has there been any moderation in the magnitude of price investments?A.C. Gallo: Hi it's A.C. No there really hasn\u2019t been moderation. We attribute the fact that the -- our gross margin did not decline as much in this quarter as we originally projected to -- largely to just a little bit better purchasing than we originally -- little better results on the purchasing side. We're able to negotiate stronger -- some stronger value discounts with some of our suppliers, especially in the grocery and produce areas than we originally thought. So when we projected that we were going to do certain investments in price as it turns out because of the volume we move, we were able to actually negotiate little bit better cost on that than we expected to. But we see -- when we look out for the rest of the year, we're holding our guidance. We still see that our sequential decline in gross margin, it will be what we have said at the beginning of the year would be. So we think -- we're going to continue with this and if we've got a little better purchasing here, we'll do a little bit deeper investment going forward for the rest of the year.David Lannon: Yes, David here too. Also I want to point out that there are so many great products that we make inside our stores and Ken and I are working with all the operators in the regions on more and more products that are made exclusively inside of our Whole Food stores. So these are products that we're manufacturing ourselves. So we're really working on recipe discipline, shrink control. So it's kind of a countervailing thing that is unrelated to the pricing efforts in things like produce and grocery and whole body and those kind of areas.Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Thanks for all the color and then just switching to competition and we continue to hear more and more about not organic expanding to other channels, I just want to understand what you guys are maybe doing differently? What you are doing differently now to combat this threat?John Mackey: I think we're doing several things that we've already sort of addressed. We are investing in value and prices. We're doing better job at controlling our expenses.", "140": " At the same time today, we've announced that we're coming out with a new format that we think will be specifically geared to address an entire generation of people coming out that we think -- that line up well with Whole Foods and this new concept will be less capital, more streamlined. It will have -- it will be value oriented and it will -- but it will still have Whole Foods quality standards. It will still have our mission and drive. We think it's going to be an exciting new concept. So these are the things that we're doing. Also in some ways, the new competition is as much as the market is expanding, a lot of people get into it for the first time and they're going to temporarily gain some share because for convenience standpoint or they migrate certain customers over, but then they anniversary that. So the question is whether they will be able to comp in comps two, three, four, five years down the road and so I mean one of the things that people don't fully understand is that even if Whole Foods Market just stopped. Our comps went flat. We were at zero. Our sales per square foot, our return on invested capital, our whole store operating model is still frankly light years better than just anybody on the other food retailer that are at least public that we have their data on. So it's going to take a long time before people can catch up with us but we're not going to sit still. We're going to continue to innovate. We're going to continue to differentiate ourselves. Our commitment to prepared foods, top of sales we do there, we're doing all that we can, but the reality is there is more competition. Hey, I wish that wasn\u2019t true, but it's where we find ourselves and we think we're doing, taking the necessary steps to compete well and continue to win in the marketplace.Walter Robb: It's Walter. I am just going to add a little bit to it. I think we're clearly in a transition to a much more expanded marketplace. You see that what you're referencing with foods and products available in many more places than historically. So I think just add a little to each of those, I mean the price thing for us what's driving for relevance on price, so we can continue our conversation about quality.", "141": " So we can really, really have this conversation about quality. And the second bucket with marketing specifically it's about communicating the differences because we don't also sell the same stuff and market sometimes wants to drop it down to lowest common denominator and while there are some common products, much of our product which is different and I think the ability for us to communicate the differences in our product and the broader offerings that we're bringing to our customers is where we're really trying to grow these efforts as well as create a kind of a personal connection through the affinity. Granted we've been a little slower perhaps than we should have been in terms of getting those things in place, but we are through the use of technology building out and extending ourselves where our customers are whether it's through Instacart for home delivery, which we're doing more than any other grocery store in America now. And we're really just getting started whether it's through affinity which builds a personal connection to customers who will allow to customize their relationship with us. whether it's through the ease of Apple pay that which we assume go to the next thing you know about, which will use customers the easier more seamless experience whether it's our improving App which ultimately these things can be put together to give customers more integrated experience with Whole Foods digitally. All those things are in the works and I wish that we were doing them faster, but we're doing them as fast as we can do as we replace all our foundational systems and technology to get there ultimately where we're going is to create this fuller richer experience basically and digitally for our customers and as John says, we're taking these steps and we're doing it at a time when the marketplace is going through a huge transition. But make no mistake about it. We still have a tremendous amount of strength in this company.John Mackey: Okay. I would like to actually add. We're talking about differentiation. We're still doing -- we're really ramping up a lot of -- our differentiation a lot on the product side and it's true that you might take some branded natural organic products that we sell and other people sell and everybody has the same things, but we've got a lot of things in place to help differentiate ourselves in product side.", "142": " We also continue to differentiate ourselves in produce with our responsively grown program and our whole trade guarantee products. We're the largest seller of fair trade produce and flours in the U.S. and we continue to expand -- rapidly expand our supply there and we've got some -- we've got some great new products coming in, in our meat and sea food department. We've established this club pack frozen program that's doing extremely well in our sea food departments and is a very unique high quality product, at really great price and so there is a lot of work going on, on the product side to continue to differentiate our product mix and really add the kind of products that our customers really like.David Lannon: Yes and this is David, on the in-store experience, we're continuing to innovate -- juice bars continue to grow as a big part of the breakfast experience in our stores. We just opened a great new juice bars with our friend JugoFresh in Miami and we have a great juice bar with our friend Vega up in Cambie. Vancouver. We're closing in on the 100 taprooms where we serve beer wine and all sort of exciting things making Pete in our new west loop store. We're continuing to be the retail innovator in terms of in-store experience. Against things you can't get online you can only get it Whole Foods Market and I encourage you guys to go into some of our new stores.Rupesh Parikh: Thank you.Operator: And the next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Stephen Grambling: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow-up on the new concept, does the distribution model have to change or do you have the capacity for these smaller stores at this point?John Mackey: We think one of the great things about this model is that we can leverage all of our existing distribution capabilities and our distribution partners. We can use our regional structure and yet we can create a more centrally driven model from a product standpoint, a pricing standpoint and overall selection standpoint, while allowing innovation to occur on a limited basis within a regional and local basis. So we think we've got the right structure to really create a new model that will be highly successful. We can talk about it in general terms. We want to limit what we talk about this call.", "143": " And we will reveal a little bit more in the next few months, but we're excited about it. We think it a big deal, but hey, proof will be when we start to open them up.Walter Robb: But the question is no, we don't need a new distribution network to serve.John Mackey: We do not need an in distribution network.Stephen Grambling: Understood, that's helpful. And then I guess changing gears a little bit, you mentioned better -- doing a better job on expense discipline and you saw some leverage on salaries and benefits among other areas, where are the improvements coming from at this point and is there kind of a new leverage point to be thinking about as it relates to the comp?John Mackey: You mean on comp on SG&A?Stephen Grambling: Correct.John Mackey: You mean on sales. The trick on expense leverage, it's just continued had work. It's retails details about getting in there and looking at your business processes. This is some we're doing right now. We have a number of task force going examining things like how we buy in the store, how we serve in prepared foods and we're looking at this and we're taking cost out of the system in a systematic basis. 29 basis points times $15 billion over a year is a heck of a lot of money and we're going to continue to do that. So I think that's what we've announced we're going to do and we're also getting leverage as we continue to grow and open new stores. We're getting leverage in our overall G&A as well as store leverage. So I think that's a long term. We look out and we do our own internal work several years in advance. We see okay we're going to continue to get expense leverage. We're going to continue to work on a process or we'll continue to take these costs out and we're going to continue to lower prices, lower our gross margins accordingly. And hopefully we'll be able to produce a similar type of bottom line that we've been producing for the last several years.", "144": " We're encouraged about what the store are doing. We're still committed to doing over 200 by the end of this year. We got some good results this quarter through these great stores. Bishops Corner and West Hartford in Connecticut, just spoke to spoke to Laura Durbin the Regional President there and their sales are higher than the regional comp number. And we're very excited to be focusing a lot of energy in Colorado, stores like Four Collins, Cherry Creek, Colfax, Wash Park, Colorado Boulevard some of our older stores where we're doing the new color, the new painting, the new look, but we're -- a significant chunk of them are going to happen in summer, which is the slowest time for sales for us, but also the most convenient time to do without getting in the way of our customers. So expect a significant chunk to happen in the June, July, August timeframe, but we're still committed to doing and encouraged to do them all by the end of the year.Stephen Grambling: Great, best of luck.Operator: And our next question comes from Jerry Gray with Cowen. Please go ahead.Jerry Gray: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So the Instacart business grew about 50% sequentially in terms of your average weekly sales volume, was there any new markets or new stores added there? Is that mostly organic growth within the existing stores?John Mackey: That is mostly organic growth. We added one small market, but the next burst of markets is soon to come.David Lannon: This is David. I would say that we're also if you look on the Instacart App, we're adding new items all the time. We're starting to add more and more of our prepared foods mix, which wasn\u2019t available and we started with Instacart. So there is a more full shop for our customers and they're responding.Jerry Gray: All right, great. And then just on the gross margin, with your produce pricing, could you give us any more details on the rollout of that and how the cadence of that is going to go in the second half and into next year as you expand that two additional markets?John Mackey: Right.", "145": " Some were doing more every day a little pricing. Others were doing stronger promotional strategy I think the ones we added in the second wave are more in the promotional side in some additional regions. Our plan is to continue with all of that going forward and then to add at some point later in the fiscal year we're going to add some more markets to it, but right now we've got plans to as we move into the new fiscal year, continue with another wave of -- with another wave of investments.Jerry Gray: All right, great. Thank you guys.Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Karen Short: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So obviously everyone acknowledge, you have a great store format and I appreciate this opportunity that you\u2019re looking into, but I guess the question I have is that you know well there is a significant opportunity with this new concept, how do you think about the risk that this new concept will start broad based decline in margins across the Board and natural and organic. And M&A obviously including a bigger gross margin risk at your Whole Food standard stores and what pace is not kind of a slippery slope on the margin front?Walter Robb: Well instead of the slippery kind of I think we\u2019ve already articulated it for the last year and half that the trajectory of the gross margins are going to continue to incrementally move down as the competitive marketplace emerges. So I think that -- we've already acknowledge that as this thing broadens and widens, but thing is the opportunity keeps getting so much bigger. Here is another way for us to do that, it's going to access other communities and other folks that we cannot access particularly with our Whole Foods Flagship brand. So no one saying that the size of the opportunity is enormous. I think we\u2019re all seeing that on unfold daily, but I think we've already going to laid out the trajectory that we see that the margins will in fact go down year-over-year for the next several years. You want to add to that John? John Mackey: Well, Karen imagine that we have these larger Whole Foods Markets flagship stores that's got think about our one in Austin for example which is a good example of big store, great prepared foods, lots of different venues, huge service, it's an experience when you go into the store and then say that\u2019s kind of the Whole Foods Market brand trajectory.", "146": " So maybe if you go into a big Whole Foods Market, maybe you've got a thousand different kinds of wine from price points all the way from $299 to a few $100, but maybe in this our concept store you'll have a more tailored mix of wine. You won\u2019t have it will just be good quality value wines and they won\u2019t have the same upward trajectory. So is it something that\u2019s going to harm Whole Foods Market? We don\u2019t see it that way. We see it as complementary. We\u2019ll see that our loyalty card program will be -- will include both brands and we see people crossing over in it and -- but one of the things that I think I\u2019ve learned from other businesses is you have to be willing to evolve with the marketplace. You have to be willing to do what it takes to serve your customers better and you cannot do that because it might possibly take sales from your existing flagship brand. You've got to be willing to serve your customers where you find them. That will be cause the Whole Foods Market flagship brand to evolve as we roll out our as our next brand. Just like it\u2019s evolving right now with the competition that we\u2019re facing. So we see that this as a huge opportunity that the natural organic foods revolution is sweeping America. We intend to be -- continue to be the leader in this category for the rest of the century. And so we\u2019re evolving with the marketplace. We\u2019re going to create a new -- we are creating a new format, a new concept it's not been seen, the non one else is done. It's going to be unique and we think it's going to be really signing to the customer base and we\u2019ll see what happens. It's hard to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen in telling to start doing them.Walter Robb: I was just going to add, I really got John brought that up, because you were there at our Investor conference. We talked a lot about us being a company that\u2019s continually changing, evolving, growing, you read the marketplace as it\u2019s and you say, how do you continue to respond? How do you continued to evolve and for us as a group thinking about it. We think this is a way for us to -- the thing gets bigger. It allows us to broaden our reach, accelerate our growth, serve more people in bringing healthier food to the world.", "147": " And I guess first question is, are you -- is the larger increase store size basically to accommodate mostly the wine bars and the beer hauls? And then can you help me to understand how that impacts ROIC going forward if in fact it is wine bar and beer haul.John Mackey: Well, I mean that's where we do have our taproom and wind bars and we want to make haul for these markets, this incredible experience for people. We want to stores to be fun. We want them to be exciting. We want them to be places that are destinations for people to come, it's an experience that -- food is a very essential, exciting thing for people. We want these stores to be incredibly exciting. So the trend line for haul foods market will probably be towards larger stores that are very experientially oriented with a very differentiated product mix for the customer base and then we will have our new format that will be, the stores will be more streamlined and won't be as large. It will be value oriented. There will be more tailored product mix. They will be tech -- they will be very tech savvy stores and they will be very exciting to we think to millennial generation of about 90 million people. So we think these concepts are very complimentary to each other. There will be some overlap, but in the best of all worlds for Whole Foods, people will shop both stores. They\u2019ll come in and enjoy the big exciting Whole Foods market and they will do fill in shops at the new concept and the stores will intermix with each other in a very unique way. And we'll have a larger product mix at the bigger flagship Whole Foods Market stores and we will the new format. We will have a more tailored mix there. So that's what's -- we really say too much more than that. There will be a bigger reveal later on as we get into this summer. So it's not that far away. You have to wait only a few months and we'll give you more.Walter Robb: But we will use our technology platforms in our programs to connect shoppers across both of them. So that will also support the complementary above right, so\u2026Karen Short: Great. Look forward to seeing it.Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s portion of the program. I will now return the floor to John Mackey for closing remarks.John Mackey: Okay.", "148": " We look forward to speaking with you again in July at our Q3 earning call. A transcript of the scripted portion of this call along with the recording of the call is available on our website as well. Everybody have a great summer. We look forward to talking to you soon, bye.Operator: And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.", "149": " Executives: A.C.

Instacart has recently expanded to Orange County, Baltimore, Charlotte, and San Antonio, with additional markets coming soon. Collectively, Whole Foods and Instacart deliver fresh groceries to more households in the United States than anyone else. We are continuing to hit major milestones in replacing our legacy systems with new technology platforms. We have completed the pilot phase for our new point-of-sale system and are now accelerating the rollout. We are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. This new, unified system will provide many benefits including operational efficiencies and consolidated item data to support personalized offers, category management and supplier collaboration. Our new labor-scheduling program is now in place across all of our U.S. customer service teams, and we plan to introduce the program to two additional store teams in Q3. With this new program, we are saving administrative time and gaining insight on how to spend labor dollars more efficiently to better serve our customers. The benefits of this new tool will be more fully realized next fiscal year and beyond as we implement it company-wide and incorporate best practices into our labor budgeting process.", "150": " Created to complement our Whole Foods Market stores, our new 365 format will offer our same industry-leading standards and dedication to food transparency, delivered in a new way. The streamlined format is designed around affordability and convenience and will be supported by enhanced digital experiences. Opening May 25th in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the 28,000 square foot store will be quickly followed by stores in Lake Oswego, Oregon and Bellevue, Washington. We believe there is customer demand for both formats, and as a second growth vehicle, 365 allows us to attack the value-quality proposition in a new way, while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. We are excited to get our first three stores open and to learn and evolve from there. We are continuing to invest in our team members' development and growth, including creating thousands of new jobs this year. Our 86,000 team members are the essential ingredient in creating our best-in-class customer experience, and we were very pleased to have once again earned a spot on FORTUNE magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. We are proud to be one of only 11 companies who have made the list every year since its inception 19 years ago. Turning now to our updated outlook, we expect to be at or below the low end of our prior sales and earnings per share ranges. While we beat our bottom line expectations in the first half of the year, primarily through better and projected leverage in salaries and benefits, our comp trends have yet to stabilize. We're hopeful that comps will improve over the course of the year as our sales building initiatives gain traction and our comparisons get easier. Beginning in week 11 of Q3, we will anniversary the sharp drop in our comps last year after a weights and measures audit generated negative national media attention. We expect the offsetting impact from our value strategy to continue, however, as we ramp up our price investments and promotions over the remainder of the year. Given our lower sales projections, we now expect SG&A leverage to be more in line with the 19 basis points we have produced year to date. This reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives, net of higher depreciation and other cost, including the additional marketing and technology investments we have approved for later in the year. Please refer to our press release for more details.", "151": " We believe we're taking the right steps to grow and improve the company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long-term We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time, so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you.Operator: We'll go first to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask if you could give us a bit more color, in terms of the pricing initiative that you're having. What are customers seemingly, at least, responding most to, whether it's by category, whether it's by medium, et cetera? And then also maybe, on top of that, from a category management standpoint, any updates there that you can share?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Hi, Vincent. This is A.C.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, A.C.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: In the pricing, like we've mentioned on our last call. A lot of our investments this year have been in the perimeter, in our perishable departments, and what we've been seeing is \u2013 and we've ramped that up, we started to really ramp that up through the year, and in Q2, we made more investments, and we did some large national promotions in Produce. We had a big citrus promotion earlier in the year, we had a really big \u2013 we had an organic strawberry promotion, which was the biggest promotion we've ever done. And for the first time, we've had marketing to go with it, we did national marketing around that. And we saw a phenomenal uplift in that. And I'd say that generally, in the areas where we've done the investments, we've been seeing a good uptick in the units.", "152": " So we're getting a much bigger lift, and a much bigger imprint, on social media with this promotional activity.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Right. We think this is a lot more visible than what we've done before. You also asked a question about category management, where we stand with that. We're doing a lot of the pick-and-shovel work right now, determining the categories, the rolling intent work for each category, hiring category leaders, really doing all that work. And we see that we're going to probably be laying the foundation through the rest of this fiscal year. And we're going to be then running a pilot at the beginning of next fiscal year in the fall. And then, once we move beyond that pilot, then we'll start to actually rollout category management later next year.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks very much. Good luck.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You noted in the press release that the average price per item was down. I think it was 80 basis points for the quarter. I just wanted to dig into this number a bit if I could, and forgive me if you've answered this already, but trying to really get a sense of how much in your view was driven by some deflationary pass-through versus, I guess, what you might consider price investments above and beyond deflation? And again, I know these are hard numbers to quantify, but any sense of that would be helpful?Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This is Glenda. What we were trying to say was that while average price per item was still up in the quarter, the increase was the lowest increase that we had seen in five years. And it was 80 basis points lower increase than what we saw in Q1. So does that help clarify? But no, we don't have any specific way other than that, pointing that out of how much of that was inflation versus change in our actual lower prices.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.", "153": " And I appreciate the commentary on digital coupons in your prepared comments. So just overall if you look at the digital coupon initiatives, how have they performed versus your expectations? And at this point, is there any way to look at it to see whether they're driving better traffic, basket size, or even more units in a transaction?Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. This is Jason. We're still in the early innings of this program, but I think as a whole, we're very excited about the results. As you saw, we've significantly increased the number of users for our app, so in addition to both using the coupons, we have a more engaged customer is now leveraging our app for the other utilities that we're providing. Our intention at this point is to continue to add features to our app, inclusive of the digital coupons leading up to our affinity rollout, which we will be piloting our next city up in Dallas, and then doing our national rollout following that test.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. I'll also say that our supplier is really excited about the digital coupons. One of the very first times at Whole Foods that our suppliers will be able to get back data analytics on the performance of their promotionals at Whole Foods. So again, we're in the early innings, but very exciting.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Philip Terpolilli with Wedbush. Please go ahead.Phil Terpolilli - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking the question. I just wanted to focus on procurements. I think you mentioned a couple things earlier, talking about category managements and sort of a timeline for the next maybe 12 months to 24 months. I'm just kind of curious maybe the feedback you're getting from some of your suppliers coming out of Expo West and sort of going into the balance of the year. How we think some of the things that you're doing right now could help the model overall? Thanks.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Hi. It's A.C. again. Suppliers, we're very excited.", "154": " We've been a very inefficient customer to deal with for a lot of suppliers, because they have to go to 11 different regions often and talk to the buyers in each region. So the idea that they can \u2013 they are going to be able to come to just to the global office and talk to the team here, work out their promotions, work out new items things like that, is something that they were very excited about and glad to hear. We know in talking with the suppliers, we formed the supplier advisory groups and we've had some meetings with them. We know that there's a lot of opportunities for us on the cost savings side, for increased promotions aspect. There's a lot of opportunities there for us to reap once we can get really rolling with category management. So we're just seeing \u2013 we see a lot of opportunities.Phil Terpolilli - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Bill Kirk of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. So it looks like there were three more lease locations that initially had been signed for regular stores that are now changed to 365. Can you talk about that decision making process? And then I guess what would need to be done to pull it off?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. Well, we did announce three conversions to Whole Foods from stores and development in Akron, Toledo and Bloomington, Indiana. And in looking at those markets and the size of the stores, we felt that they were better suited to be a 365 location, particularly as we looked at the size of stores. We feel that Whole Foods Market stores going forward should be 45,000 plus square feet, and the stores that we converted were approximately 30,000 square feet. So more value markets and the right size for 365. So that's why we change those to 365.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. We hadn't started the design process on any of those stores, so there's no added expense to change the concept.", "155": " Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Joe Edelstein with Stephens. Please go ahead.Joe Edelstein - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Hello? Can you hear me?David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Good afternoon. Yes, we're here.Joe Edelstein - Stephens, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could speak more to the cadence in the sales trends during the quarter. We've heard others say it's been choppy month-to- month, even week-to-week. So really, if it has bounced around quite a lot, I'm just curious to maybe even drill down even into some of the three week trends that you've seen so far into the quarter. Just how true of a trend line is that, if it has been quite volatile? So any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The improvement that we've seen in the three weeks is in the items per basket, which, it would be nice if that trend would continue. But it is three weeks, it's a very short amount of time. And I would hesitate to draw any conclusions at all from that, because certainly, things do move around quite a bit from week-to-week and with any short period of time.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: We do think a couple of good things are going to happen later on in this quarter. So, as every month passes, the cannibalization impacts in Chicago from our 10 new Dominick stores we opened last fiscal year moderates, as we anniversary it. And we're starting to see some positive results there, and that's going to continue the rest of fiscal year. So that's going to be a wind to our backs instead of \u2013 it's been a headwind for the last \u2013 over the last year. Secondly, as we get into the very end of this quarter, we will anniversary the weight-to-measures audit that happened to us in New York City that went national, and definitely took a tremendous amount of sales from Whole Foods Market.", "156": " It's one that's been settled for a number of months. So, it's just looking in the rear-view mirror. And also I think, just as we pick-up through \u2013 into the fourth quarter, the comparisons in general just get easier. The backdrop is a bit choppy, in terms of the macroeconomic environment, but I think we're not calling the bottom, but I think there's lots of things that are very encouraging here, in terms of a turning point, but too early to call that.Joe Edelstein - Stephens, Inc.: Appreciate the comments, and good luck.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. In terms of your price investments, I know you've lowered prices on quite a few items this year, and there's more to come. I'm curious how you think about the consumer response for price investments versus digital coupons and promo activity. Where do you think that you're getting more bang for your buck so far? And how do you plan to balance the two going forward?John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's been very interesting. Doing the price investments, the different \u2013 we see different customers react to different things. The digital coupons have been very, very popular, like with our affinity customers in Philadelphia, and the price/item investments we've done. We're studying the effects, but we're definitely seeing, in some markets, much more of a response to them than others. We're seeing, in certain departments, we're seeing a lot more response to them than others. So it's still really early in our price investments. We purposefully designed this to roll out kind of slow and steady, so we could learn from it and see what people really respond to. And I think the really exciting thing, though, that we've been doing is that we're really ramping up our marketing behind them.", "157": " So that I think is really the next big step for us, because I think I said earlier, just lowering some prices here and there and doing some promotions, if people don't really know about them, we're not going to get the full effect. And so, I'm really excited that we've got now \u2013 we're going to have the marketing muscle behind a lot of what we're doing. We're putting that in place, so as we do more investments going forward, we've got \u2013 people are going to know about them.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: And this is David. I'd also say, bragging about our team members, we're the best merchandisers in any supermarket in the United States. So our team members know that when we're doing promotions, now that we're inviting more customers in through advertising and digital as well as radio and other mediums, that they know if they really go for it on the merchandising that the customers are going to come in. We're adding more customers all the time. So it's kind of a virtuous circle between our team members and our customers.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: If I could \u2013 this is Walter, if I could just add one comment. I think the idea is here, we're doing multiple things to serve the customer who now today's customer is coming to the store, but also searching online and doing lots of preparation for food shopping or even food shopping online. So I think the fact we're reaching out both through the store, through the price changes there which we recognize have a longer lag time, so to speak, to return, because it takes a trip to convert that to business. But then also offering the digital offers, offering the customer both of those choices, I think we're kind of working the mix of short-term, medium-term and long-term in terms of offering our customers a better value.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks a lot, guys. Really appreciate that.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, can you just elaborate on what exactly is fundamentally changing in the cost structure?", "158": " And those, I think, we talked about primarily in the salaries and benefits area, also in restructuring the organization. So we're on track with that. You can see that reflected in the results here. I'm not sure what more specifics you're looking for with that, Stephen? I mean we're looking at every aspect of the business, and we're redesigning our back rooms in cases. We're putting in standard operating procedures across the company. We are pioneering one central kitchen in our stores, which is leading the labor efficiencies. We're doing all kinds of stuff. Ken and David might have some additional color.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah, I would just point out our leader in distribution, Bart Beilman who's leading our SOP process that we're seeing huge results in our test regions in the mid-Atlantic and also here in Austin, where we're seeing a much higher percentage of our inventory moving to the sales floor and out of our back rooms. We want to talk about it more on the next call, but we really feel that this is going to be a large reduction in excess inventory sitting in the back of our house, in addition to a decrease in shrink, and also overall improvement in team member morale, because the back rooms are in much better shape. So early days, but very exciting. And Ken and I are planning on rolling this out as fast as we can across all the stores.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: And John mentioned \u2013 this is Ken here. John mentioned the central kitchen that we just launched in our Wall store. And the power of that is it's simplifying the workflow in our stores so that we're not \u2013 we don't have the redundancies of production that we once had. That one person, the most expert person is producing the product that's then distributed to all the other teams in the stores. We think that that's revolutionary in the way in which we'll operate our stores. We'll have a higher-quality product.", "159": " Just to kind of put a big frame on that. I think if we look at our business, we say we were the ones that put a lot of energy and time into the customer experience, into the retail experience, into the store experience. And we had such a pretty strong regional structure and I think were, as a result of this crossroads and transformation we're going through, we're looking at all the systems that supports the processes on how we do work and how we're structured, everything from soup to nuts, really, looking at everything in terms of how we can simplify, eliminate redundancies, do work differently, find more savings through just streamlining the organization. And that has just led to some \u2013 it leads to the land of opportunity for Whole Foods. And I think that perhaps other supermarkets have been there and done that. And I think we're just arriving and realizing there's lots there, even as we continue to work hard on stepping up the experience that we're delivering to our customers. So I think that's one big way to think about it.Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful color. And then I guess as a follow-up to your last comment on, you're kind of doing a lot of the things that the other supermarkets had done, and you also had mentioned price investments, a loyalty program as it relates to the other initiatives. And those also sound pretty similar to what conventional competitors are doing. So maybe you can provide color on some of the other things or aspects that you're trying to implement that will actually differentiate Whole Foods from the group, rather than moving more closely to them? Thanks.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Well, we only ever made the case \u2013 we are talking about price relevancy, we're talking about doing the things that we need to do to be relevant in the marketplace that we're now competing in today. We've all seen the changes. That's not our \u2013 if you look at our nine-point plan, and now as we continue to talk about it today, we're putting a lot of emphasis on continuing to provide new experiences, different experiences. We're opening up all the digital platforms, to be able to reach our customers in new ways and different ways than we've been able to do previously. So really, this is about much more than just price investments.", "160": " You're constantly chewing up, not just on these conference calls, but you're chewing up every day in the marketplace, as markets change. But hopefully what you're hearing out of this group is a much broader thought process around how we think we can set ourselves apart, continue to differentiate, and gain some momentum, and that's \u2013 A.C. mentioned the promotions, but the marketing around that, which also talks about the quality of the product, the opening up some of these platforms to offer new content and new options for customers. For example, they can shop for food now through wholefoodsmarket.com, that's a new thing we haven't been able to do before. So in all these ways, I think we're trying to \u2013 and the 365 John mentioned is of course another growth opportunity for the company, and serving the customers in new ways. So I think you take the whole big picture and you say, there's a lot going on here to regain momentum.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: I also want to \u2013 this is Ken. I also want to share the fact that our commitment around culinary is really what separates us compared to the competition, and so we have the leadership now in the company to bring that focus and that commitment to really developing new programs. We have the friends of Whole Foods Market, which are bringing really great restaurant concepts into our stores. And having these partnerships that create a unique experience from a culinary standpoint. That really is, by far, above anything that we're competing against right now. So we really feel like the renewed focus on culinary in our stores is a big, big differentiator for us as a company.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, John here. So, how are we differentiated? I mean A, we're going to create a whole new brand, 365, stores that you'll have to go see, and we've got 19 of those signed up, and many more in negotiation right now. We think that's going to be a huge opportunity for us that's going to help set us apart. And then, all of our stores continue to innovate. When you go into our new stores, go into the downtown LA, take a trip to Southern California in three weeks. We're opening a new brand, go see our downtown LA store while you're at it.", "161": " Everybody's continuing to try to copy us, because the innovations are still occurring at Whole Foods Market. That's how we are differentiating. Now if you mean \u2013 sure, we're copying some of the things that some of our competitors do, we're learning from everybody. And competitors are doing some things better than Whole Foods, we certainly want to learn from that and make our company better. But we are not standing still. In fact, I would argue that we're probably undergoing far more an evolution in our company than ever before. And the final and probably the most important point, nobody, nobody comes close to matching our quality standards. We're the only supermarket in America that's 100% cage-free eggs, that has an animal welfare system that's top-rated in Greenpeace for seafood sustainability. We're doing over $3 billion a year in prepared foods and bakery, we're a large restaurant operator. Our stores are very different than our competitors, and we're not standing still. We're continuing to grow, evolve and differentiate ourselves.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: And that's why 800 people were standing in line this morning for our Westford store opening and our 40th store in our North Atlantic region this morning.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, congratulations to Laura and team out there. That's good.Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. Thanks so much. Best of luck the rest of the year.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi. It's Mark Wiltamuth. Our surveys are starting to show some Trader Joe's discounting out there. Are you seeing that? And are you reacting to it? Or, what are your thoughts on what you're seeing in the market right now?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: We noticed last \u2013 I think starting in November that Trader Joe's had lowered prices in certain items, in certain markets. And we monitor Trader Joe's and other competitors very closely, and we make sure we have certain price bandwidth that we make sure that we follow with them.", "162": " So \u2013 but I don't think it's \u2013 I don't think that was highly unusual. I think that Trader Joe's and all our other competitors regularly raise and lower prices depending on, sometimes it's just based on \u2013 and generally it's based on markets like a couple years ago, last year, olive oil crop in Italy was terrible and Trader Joe's raised their olive oil prices. And this year, olive oil crop is much better in Europe and everybody's lowering, they lower their olive oil prices. So, I mean, that's \u2013 it's just kind of the way it works. I don't think it was anything unusual or stand-apart from what normally happens.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then on the \u2013 following-up on the cannibalization question, how is the sequential progress on cannibalization from first quarter into the second quarter?Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, the cannibalization impact does ease over the course of the year as we anniversary the openings in Florida and Chicago, which were our two hardest-hit markets. So it was a little better in Q2 than in Q1, and will get even better in Q3, and then even better in Q4.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, thanks for taking my question. Just on 365, I was hoping, could you remind us, 19 stores you're going to be opening, assuming these go well and it sounds like they could, can you remind us the expectation, if this goes really well, the kind of profit contribution 365 could have? Are these expected to be higher-margin stores than the core Whole Foods stores? Just maybe a little bit of a \u2013 and maybe some of the metrics you'll be looking at when you decide how many to open over the next few years? Thanks.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, we have to open them up and see.", "163": " I suspect when we come to our fourth quarter earnings call in November, we'll have some hard data on the first three openings. And we'll be able to give you some much more concrete information as opposed to just sort of speculation. We're expecting them to have very good returns on invested capital and to be very profitable for us. So, yeah, we think they're going to be accretive, and \u2013 but we've got to get them up to speed.Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And, John, can you remind us, do they leverage off being close to other Whole Foods stores because you're not clustering the concept based on the stores you've announced so far? And does that make it harder for that chain to be profitable?John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no, because all the stores are being, from an operational \u2013 although the product selection, the pricing, the overall programming is all occurring from our global offices, the actual operations of the store is going to be in the regions, so they get all the advantages of scale that we have in our regions and scales in purchasing while we've been able to program the pricing, the products, the strategy, the decor, the design, all of that from Austin. So we think we're getting the best of both worlds there.Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Look forward to seeing the store.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: So do we.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to David Magee with SunTrust. Please go ahead.David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. My question also has to do with 365. I'm curious how you'll market that concept? Maybe you're doing it already or once it opens up. And are you seeing anything now whether it's social media buzz or otherwise that gives you confidence that the demand is out there? Thank you.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: David and Ken, we'll both answer that. We can tell you that everybody is very curious about this, so it's definitely not going to be a secret. Jeff Turnas, our President of 365, did deskside interviews with all sorts of folks in New York last week.", "164": " We're also going to be doing some traditional stuff, advertising in the LA Times, as well as lots of social media, working with BuzzFeed, a few other groups.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: And just last week, we had a launch event in New York where we invited all of the press to \u2013 and our partners, we had over 200 people there to sort of introduce the concept. And like David said, using BuzzFeed is going to be one of our big vehicles to get out into the social media. We are now having a two hour dance party in the morning before we open if you want to show \u2013 if any of the investors want to show up.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Definitely a good thing to start the day with. It's a day breaker.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: Day breaker.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Investor shuffle.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ah, I love it.David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, and good luck.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Joseph Feldman with Telsey Advisory. Please go ahead.Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Hi, guys. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, as you guys look at your most loyal customers, like those core shoppers that they're in there every week, they're your regular guys. Have you seen any change in their behavior lately? Or is it really those kind of, the casual fringe customer that you've seen a little bit of a drop off with?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, this is Walter. Yeah, there were \u2013 we've got a pretty good read on that, and I would say very pleased that the core shoppers continues to stay with us, and is staying pretty consistent frequency and also basket. Where the erosion has happened, it simply has, and the comeback will happen, is also what we more broadly call the occasional shoppers who come in at different frequencies and for different amounts. And that's where I think folks may be perhaps where we've seen a little bit more inconsistency. So that's the answer.Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Got you.", "165": " And then just one quick follow-up. As far as marketing goes, how have you guys been measuring the marketing efficacy or the return on the marketing? Is there any thought to go back to like, I think it was last year, you guys did the national branding and that seem to really have an impact to drive some sales for a little while. So just curious about how you're viewing that?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got something up our sleeves, but nothing to announce today other than we're working on something, and we're excited about it. I think we get (28:21) the 365 stores launched, get some data on that. Get our national affinity program launched. We want to get some pieces in place, and as we get those in place, then I think we will launch a more broad-based marketing strategy. So we'll have probably, again, we'll have something to talk about in Q4 about that. Probably, I think, the investments we're making in, as A.C. detailed earlier. I think obviously, the ultimate measure of those are the sales, is traffic and sales. And we're seeing the first chapter of that, which is kind of the units begin to move a little bit, which then leads from there. On the digital side obviously, you can measure things differently. One of the real advantages of affinity for us, and we enjoy that in Philadelphia and soon to be in Dallas. Is that we actually create personalized offers and connections with customers. So we can actually through the tokenized data, we can actually follow what the customers is actually doing over time. And then we can also look at the segments and how we can respond to groups of customers as well. So we're putting in place some really good tools to be able to measure the investments. They are a lot easier to measure there than they are, say, on the promos that we're doing on the perishables right now, because that kind of all comes back just to comps and sales and units, and that sort of thing. So that's where we are with those two.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Also, David, affinity will be in place from day one at 365 as well.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good point, David. Yeah, good point.Operator: Thank you.", "166": " Please go ahead.Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good evening, thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to go back to the price investments. I think if I heard you correctly, it sounds like you're getting a good uptick in the units but not quite enough to offset the magnitude of the price investment. And I'm just wondering if you are looking at other ways, maybe just not promotions, but more of an EDLP effort as you kind of broaden some of the price investments to other categories? Or how do you think you're going to get that elasticity I guess?John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, our price investments are really a combination of promotions and EDLPs. We evaluate each category, each department in the store, and kind of have that two-pronged strategy. We have \u2013 last year we probably did a little more on the EDLP. This year, we're kind of doing a combination. We focused for instance in the produce department where we've taken certain categories and we've moved the regular pricing. We move the regular pricing down in a few categories. At the same time, we've done some really strong promotions, because you really \u2013 you got to kind of do both in order to \u2013 the promotions might bring people in, but then once they're in the store they want to see \u2013 the regular prices they look at are really important if they're going to buy beyond the promotion. So it's very important to do both. But I think, ultimately, you know it's really through the category management program that we're going to be able to determine what is actually the right mix between in each department for adjusting everyday pricing, for doing more promotion. We're going to be able to really look and see how not only \u2013 and we're going to be able to do a lot of testing with that to really understand what is the most effective for our customers. Because as Walter was saying earlier and answering the question about our kind of more core shoppers than more our occasional shoppers, different strategies work for these different customers.", "167": " And just in terms of the comparisons if I could just ask one more quick one, they get a lot easier as we move forward here. But last year one of the big initiatives was also some of the remodels. I know some of them were minor, some of them were more major. But how should we think about cycling maybe some of the remodels and the impact from those?David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah, this is David. With 450 stores in our base, we're constantly remodeling and refreshing our stores. So we did the core refresh in a lot of our stores last year, but we're continuing to do that work as well as remodels. I would say in general though, we're trying to focus on smaller size remodels that have a bigger sales impact and doing a lot of focus on prepared foods, bakery, and also conversion from full-service venues to self-service venues. So customers are responding well to that, and we're able to get labor reductions at the same time. So that's kind of where we're focusing our capital spending, not on new stores.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 earnings call in late July. If you get a chance and you're in L.A., check out our Silver Lake store which opens in three weeks. Maybe go to our downtown L.A. store, you can see the contrast right there between what Whole Foods Market is evolving to and what the new 365 format will be. Okay, everybody. We'll talk to you soon.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results to the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017 only, and include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.", "169": " Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. And that's what I mentioned about this time last year.", "170": " The other comment I would make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still \u2013 we lapped that most of the first half this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to build the capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing \u2013 accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have \u2013 that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them.", "171": " And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable \u2013 all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate.", "172": " On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year. It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program.", "173": " But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the \u2013 we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Again, as I said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and also we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 databases over the last year-and-a-half. We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California Polytechnic State University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new regions.", "174": " So, yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer than anybody else.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two as probably larger than normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two.", "175": " And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also \u2013 in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music. Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. We do learn. It's something to do in every city and have different \u2013 slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service, though, and we also have \u2013 so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople.", "176": " I know it's early, but be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. It's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's \u2013 I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step up in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So, we built self-service tools and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split, really, but I would see both growing.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step-up in stock-based compensation. Thank so much.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion.", "177": " I'll also say that we generally see a step-up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also \u2013 it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2. On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, guys. You mentioned before just stand of new fulfillment centers, it takes a bit of time for them to ramp optimization. How should we think about that path optimization over a year or so? As you continue to scale operations and you bring data to bear and robotics and Kivas and AI machine learning, are you finding that kind of new fulfillment center optimization curve is accelerating?Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes.", "178": " We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from line of from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Just one, other slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53% year-over-year. Anything to call out? And then just you made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus large footprints if you're thinking about that? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: I'm sorry. What was the first part of your question?Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: The other, other revenue slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53%. Is there anything to call out around that?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like cobranded credit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more the variance and the volatility is in the other line items. Your question on stores, we are \u2013 again, I personally think the new devices, the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer.", "179": " A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website through at least the end of the quarter.", "180": " Executives: Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.

Please go ahead?Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.", "181": " Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe reasons for the ad business to accelerate within the other line? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had \u2013 what I attribute it to is continued strength in our \u2013 some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold.", "182": " Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued \u2013 it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I think, it was 17%, any particular things to call out there as that would have stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just \u2013 the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth.", "183": " On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown \u2013 we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis. But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. But this year it's a little more apparent.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square footage increases this year? And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, today.", "184": " We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll \u2013 we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting retail business?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas. We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service.", "185": " There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that, when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else. So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall. And \u2013 hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of \u2013 the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to AWS, you're adding new customers to AWS, can you give us a sense of sort of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful \u2013 you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow? And then, you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case?", "186": " How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we \u2013 we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very \u2013 that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate. But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures, Q2 was 67%. This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a \u2013 there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks. I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone \u2013 a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "187": " The first one on the ad business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product? And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to \u2013 whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site. Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to invent new products for those advertisers. We also think measurement is going to be important so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service.", "188": " So $640 million more is in other revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter. In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit? And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of purchasing? Thank you so much.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go to Whole Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit, it's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to as I said popular daily sales. So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well.", "189": " So the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops. Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries. It is different than \u2013 we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services \u2013 so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention on that front as well.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members? Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at International, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse where that improvement's coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America. But you're right. We continue to invest.", "190": " We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue. But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin. But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the \u2013 on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill. One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set.", "191": " Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And for a 3P, I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you started maybe last 12 months or so. When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you charge for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect state taxes. Thank you.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and remitting. We haven't said \u2013 and to your second point we've not talked about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really early days.Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any thoughts about how you would monetize on third-party devices? And then just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of \u2013 that's expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands.", "192": " And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, so \u2013 including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there. So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I think, we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, because it's clear to us that customers want that option to be able to add that content as part of their Prime memberships.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.", "193": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, July 25, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.", "194": " Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Brian Nowak: I have two. It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is in that? So which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We feel this really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer. On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only in being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month. So we're in the middle of the journey here.", "195": " International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity in the off-season also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs were moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers. And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today. And as I said in other setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines hardlines non-sortable as we call them. The initial two-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same day although on a much smaller scale. So, it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now. We expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters, but when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time. As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.Heath Terry: Great. Thanks. Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business.", "196": " On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers. We released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of enterprise migrations. So, I would say that on a percentage growth basis again on a dollar basis, it's going very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year. There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Justin Post: Great. Couple of questions. I guess, the first question is just happens with the customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day what happens? And the second question, we've heard from some smaller checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the one piece side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third-party from first-party? Thanks a lot.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2 the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're saying is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait two days on, they can wait one day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site.", "197": " So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time. On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the move from 1P to 3P, but no there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different on whether -- we're focused on price convenience and selection for our customers. And whether product is a retail offering or third-party offering is not that important to us. As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales. In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. So in the release you made a comment about automotive and Alexa, anything you want to elaborate a little more that looks like that's a very interesting opportunity? And then with respect to India, there were two comments in the release, but anything you can comment on kind of getting past some of the issues that had impacted the business in the past? I know you're past that now. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with India. So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world.", "198": " So it's a win-win. We've also introduced package-free shipment program in nine cities. This is going to be a big part of our shipment zero program, a vision to make all Amazon shipment net carbon zero. On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable predicable policy that allow us to continue investing in our technology and infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses. So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. So, that's factored into our international \u2013 excuse me, our, revenue growth rate for the quarter.Dave Fildes: Yes, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really a more and more place. I think the point you're probably referencing is, we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in. So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle. So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. So a lot of this of course is just around the great power of Alexa and being able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers can interact with that and we're seeing a lot of good momentum with usage and how customers are interacting with Alexa. But also when you look at the broader environment of third-party devices, devices that we're rolling out in all of those things it's -- we're seeing a lot of good momentum there. And I think it's underpinned by the fact that Alexa is always getting smarter and so customers are enjoying the benefit of that enhanced experience.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please proceed.Youssef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me please. Can you quantify the cost of one-day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million?", "199": " And then you guys made a very intriguing acquisition, the Sizmek acquisition sometime back. I'm just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? And is the idea to try to build may be a double click like-minded model, sorry using that platform? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Hi, Youssef. Let me start your question on one-day. I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter. Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one-day and other cost issues. So we're always working within a range. We're confidently we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2. And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter. We'll see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance. So I wouldn't break out the dollar term. I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well. And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.Dave Fildes: Yes. And then just on Sizmek quickly. We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. Customers are going to be able to continue to use those proven products and services. We're invested in the long-term success of Sizmek. And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base. So we're looking forward to work with that team and we'll share more updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in the future.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "200": " Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day? And I just -- the commentary in the press release about this acceleration from one-day, sounds great. It's a little surprising that you would see the reaction that quickly. But maybe this really is -- well you're obviously seeing it. You're confident you'll also see it as you roll out into international markets, if you could just comment on that? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. The -- of course the proportion of one-day shipments is higher in international to begin with in a lot of our countries. So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime. So yes, I would say, you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. It's automatically built in. You're surprised by the speed. It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. It's growing and it's pervasive. So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. At least that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope again as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities. I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 48% year-over-year and that's a combination of a few things. First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products.", "201": " We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content in particular internationally. So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year. So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.Ross Sandler: Hey guys, just two questions. The North America retail acceleration was 3.5 points and you mentioned international is about one. So can we attribute the difference to one-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to one-day? And then Brian related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic. Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%.", "202": " But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses. Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that. If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Pleased proceed.Mark May: Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. First I guess sort of an organizational question, but some of the feedback I've heard from the ecosystem is that it appears that the combination of the way Amazon's organized internally and just rapid growth in the ad business 1P, 3P that at times there are signs that kind of these teams internally are not always aligned and maybe that creates some issues. And just wonder first do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe in the past haven't always been organized internally that way? And then secondly in terms of subscription revenue where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year and will this have any meaningful impacts in that lines growth say in Q3 of the back half of the year? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. So, I assume your first question is about the coordination of advertiser with teams that are interacting with vendors and sellers, perhaps is that what you meant?Mark May: Exactly. Yes.Brian Olsavsky: Okay.", "203": " So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there. So, I can't comment on any certain -- on exactly what issues you might be talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon. But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. But hopefully that is a temporary condition. On subscription revenue, yes, we -- you remember we raised the price of Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally. You may see that -- may have seen we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.Colin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. I guess first up curious just a follow-up on the ASP comments if those were \u2013 if that shift within the same categories or just lower ASPs imply diversification into new categories. But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yes.", "204": " So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well. So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the two biggest days we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. So it was a good test for us. And, sorry, your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a bit. I mean they -- what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth relative to good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little vary to put too much into the unit growth number. As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have \u2013 are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our headwinds to our unit growth number, but again happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.Brent Thill: Thanks. Brian just on the op income guide for the next quarter, it's significantly below where many of us are at. I'm curious if you could just talk to any changes around expenses and the success of one day just doubling down or can you just walk through what's transpires in the next quarter? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So again the biggest individual item is the one-day shipping. As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and we'll see more in international. So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place.", "205": " Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks. So that is the biggest individual contributor but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in marketing, the step up in infrastructure spending that should continue. We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh. So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity. We expected a step up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going. We\u2019re seeing more of it in Q2 and we'll see it through the remainder of the year.Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe a few small questions on the advertising side of the business if I can. How much of the advertising business would you be willing to say is driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the international side? Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity? We continue to hear from a lot of people in the advertising industry that you might be a bigger player in video advertising later this year or more into next year, how do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just possibility of being a driver in your platform overall? Thanks so much for the color guys.Dave Fildes: Yes, Eric this is Dave. I think started with the video advertising that one focus areas for us is expanding our video and over the top offerings for brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, just things like Amazon Publisher service integrations and simplifying access for third-party apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. So some interesting areas that we're continue to put a lot of focus into.", "206": " A lot of the tools that we've rolled out introduced in places like the United States aren't available in many of the international regions. And so, it's a matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of buildup, not only awareness but just how those -- add things like sponsored products interact with customers and how they receive -- building up the things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So, expected to continue see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out.Dave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter.", "207": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.David Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "208": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times. Amazon\u2019s second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines. At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June. We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We\u2019re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide.", "209": " And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales. Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers. We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection. I\u2019d point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we\u2019ve seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions. I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we\u2019re continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million. We\u2019ve also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we\u2019ve had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That\u2019s not the case this year, but what that\u2019s meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we\u2019ll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year. Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.", "210": " A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing. In addition, I\u2019ll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4. Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7. In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We\u2019re extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.Operator: At this time, we\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller, please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you\u2019re seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized non-essentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus non-essentials right in terms of offering to customers?", "211": " If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great. Thank you so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming non-essential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April. So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high. On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much zero cost \u2013 or excuse me, zero profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We\u2019ve got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I\u2019d say, early part of May. So since then, I would say it\u2019s getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we\u2019re seeing on \u2013 it\u2019s driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They\u2019re shopping more often. They have larger basket sizes. There\u2019s still a heavy component of grocery \u2013 online grocery sales tripled year-over-year in the quarter as we added capacity there. So well, there\u2019s shifts in the mix based on what customers want. It\u2019s looking a little more normal, and it\u2019s staying at a very high level. On one day, we realize that our first priority is to keep our employees safe, and the second is focus on getting our capacity increased. Once we\u2019ve done that, we are working very hard to get faster shipments.", "212": " So we\u2019ll continue to work on that. But again, first priority is definitely keeping employees safe, and second is increasing our capacity.David Fildes: Yes. And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, Brian\u2019s opening comments there, a lot of these order trends and activity, you can see that both the North America and the International segment are growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and first-party and third-party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or FBA sellers, we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth across the board, kind of similar-type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well as our international regions, in particular, our more established international regions.Operator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney: Okay. So two, just a quick follow-up on Eric\u2019s question. Brian, when do you think you\u2019ll get back to par in terms of one day being one day? And then secondly, these profit levels are super high now. They\u2019re becoming super high at the company if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how profitable the company is becoming? Is he happy about it? And I\u2019m kind of being facetious, obviously, when I asked that. But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment areas, and at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are really building out some of the markets that you\u2019ve \u2013 like India, Brazil and Mexico or the business-to-business operations, like there\u2019s a ton of new investment areas, and it seems like the Amazon historically, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know you\u2019ve got spend on COVID, but as you think about the next three to five years, you\u2019ve got these really profit surges. How can you deploy those? Or how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas? Thanks a lot.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, we don\u2019t know yet.", "213": " So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue than Q4 of last year, which is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year. So we\u2019ve kind of moved the peak forward, and for different reasons, we\u2019re trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting \u2013 is making sure our employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online because we do not have \u2013 in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in Q2, like I mentioned, we were able to use the excess capacity that did exist to serve the higher demand. Now as we move into Q3, we\u2019re starting to \u2013 we need to build the inventory more for Q4, and we\u2019ve run out of space. So we\u2019ve got our hands full on that challenge, but we\u2019ve got a really good team that\u2019s been working very hard probably since late February on this issue. And when you talk about profitability, we\u2019ll also mention that there are a couple of expenses that have gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by about 1/3 in Q2 as \u2013 mainly because we\u2019re trying to manage demand. It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in \u2013 at the end of Q2, but \u2013 and therefore, we\u2019ll see a higher level in Q3. But certainly, marketing costs were lower. You probably saw it in a lot of companies. Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical costs in some examples or in some cases have been delayed as people don\u2019t go to the doctor or don\u2019t go there as quickly. We think that will normalize over time. And as far as investments, we\u2019ve got a lot of investments already in play. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of necessarily accelerating investment or \u2013 we\u2019re always looking for new investments that make sense to us. But during this time, I would say we\u2019ve actually accelerated our ops investment. We pulled in capacity that we probably didn\u2019t think would be needed until 2021, maybe later.", "214": " This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and some of the growth statements that Brian talked about at the opening of the call, whether it was strength in Prime membership and the acceleration we saw in the U.S. or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery momentum or the doubling of video hours, for us, it\u2019s just another encouraging sign. We think there\u2019s still a lot more value we can add to that program. And that\u2019s not just in the United States where we\u2019ve got sort of a broader set of services than some of the other regions, but really focusing on supporting in some of those other regions. And so we\u2019ve got places like Australia, the Middle East. We\u2019ve talked about India many times, but a lot of focus on building that out. I think what\u2019s great about a place \u2013 all geographies with a place like India is we\u2019re really focused on digitizing the Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium-sized businesses there. We launched some new features there to help support the digitization efforts with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there.Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Brian, is going back to the investments, and you\u2019re often making multiyear investments for customers and customer offerings, and you\u2019re the man behind the capital allocation plan. I guess I\u2019d be curious to hear about can you give us some examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year because of shelter in place and the higher demand that you\u2019ve been seeing? So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan? And then the second one, the international strength, I appreciate the color on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they could be more or less profitable than the U.S. long-term?", "215": " I think you\u2019ll \u2013 starting with that second one. You\u2019ll notice that the International segment was profitable this quarter, and that\u2019s a great sign. It is heavily driven by the pickup in demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I believe, in multiple calls. What\u2019s going on internationally is we have some very healthy established countries that we\u2019ve been in a long time. And we have probably accelerated their adoption of Prime benefits. We\u2019ve pushed video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S. So there\u2019s a bit of a forward investment on Prime benefits in many of those countries. But what you also see are investments in new countries. Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and Australia are recent addition. So there\u2019s always an element of expansion going on there. Advertising is growing, so that\u2019s a good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on a run rate. So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some capacity and things in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The UK in particular, was very strong because there\u2019s probably more stay-at-home orders and the way the economy was developing in the UK. We had a very, very strong quarter there. So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. And I\u2019m not sure that, that is going to continue for the next couple of quarters, but it\u2019s a good sign that we could leverage that. And a lot of the same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime \u2013 more frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and perhaps we got a glimpse of the future on the demand curve. Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what we\u2019ve had to slow down. It\u2019s mostly \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been done necessarily for cost reasons, it\u2019s been done for people reasons. The one I\u2019d point to is studios. We\u2019ve had to delay production. I think most studios have.", "216": " And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are having trouble creating new content across the board. And that\u2019s a bit of a challenge, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019re doing intentionally. We\u2019re doing it to protect the actors and film crews, and we think that\u2019s the right decision. As I said, a lot of the investments are being pulled in, especially on the upside and grocery delivery, same-store pickup. A number of whole food stores that you can pick up deliveries on tripled this quarter. So the list is short on things that we\u2019re slowing down on, I would say. It\u2019s just we\u2019re adapting and probably looking at whether some things have changed and creating some things for the new environment, especially in the entertainment area.Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. Brian, first, just curious about your overall thoughts on how the e-commerce adoption curve has been shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around behavior for new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the $43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you could comment just on the pace of IT decision-making in this environment, whether you\u2019re still impacted by some clients more highly exposed to challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can accelerate growth going forward? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS segment revenue, what we see are companies are working really hard right now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like hospitality and travel but pretty much across the board. We\u2019re helping them. We\u2019re actively, with our sales force, looking for ways that we can help them save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best practices. So that\u2019s not going to help our usage growth in the short run, but it will help those customers save money. And we think that\u2019s the right thing to do, not only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but also for the long-term health of our relationship with them as an AWS provider.", "217": " They realize their on-premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or down. And especially in the time of sinking demand, it\u2019s a big fixed cost for them. So we expect \u2013 we\u2019re seeing migration plans accelerate. They\u2019re certainly not going to happen overnight, but we see companies moving more in that direction. We think that will be a good long-term trend. And there\u2019s certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. And it\u2019s a bifurcated world out there. So the \u2013 on your e-commerce adoption, I think it\u2019s hard to tell. We\u2019re super encouraged by the fact that grocery delivery has picked up, and that\u2019s been accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are glad to be there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying more. We do know that there\u2019s reasons that there are other options are limited. I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in store, but less people want to go into stores perhaps now. So we\u2019re going to have to see what is maybe a step-up in the curve and getting to a point quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like \u2013 hopefully, things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in the fullness of time become onetime purchases, but we\u2019ll see. And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. We\u2019re seeing similar trends. We\u2019re seeing good pickup in frequency and basket size for new members in Prime as well, certainly not the same as people have been Prime members for a number of years. But it\u2019s encouraging. And as you saw, Prime growth retention has increased. We\u2019ve accelerated the number of \u2013 the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. and internationally. So that\u2019s a good sign that we\u2019re happy about. And we hope that, that has long-term ramifications.Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler: Yes. Just a follow-up to that last comment. So the Prime behavior for international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is a little bit behind.", "218": " Any comment there? And then on the 3Q guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much of the deceleration \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a really strong number for 3Q, but the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can you just talk about what kind of behaviors you\u2019re seeing right now as you go into 3Q? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Right. Well, we ramped up through the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 41% year-over-year growth in FX-neutral \u2013 on an FX-neutral basis. A lot of those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say that the \u2013 if you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 33% growth rate in Q3. So I can\u2019t break out exactly the Prime impact because there\u2019s \u2013 but suffice to say, it\u2019s a big driver on why 41% growth in Q2 turns into 24% to 33% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher revenue volume. And then on Prime behavior, it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t really give you more on that because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, aggregate does not matter that much. And what I would say is, generally, what we\u2019re seeing is similar trends in international in response to COVID purchasing patterns. I wouldn\u2019t say it closed the gap. I said \u2013 I would say they both went up. And we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. I think there\u2019s definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping. There\u2019s a myriad of factors that go into a Prime member\u2019s decision to be a Prime member and to what they buy and what they use as far as our benefits that we give them. So I don\u2019t want to make too many sweeping comments on that right now.Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brent Thill: Thanks, good afternoon. I was curious if you could just expand on AWS. There was a little bit of a slowdown across the board and a number of the cloud numbers.", "219": " And perhaps just talk about the backlog. I know you\u2019ve disclosed the backlog has been improving in the filings, but a little more color on AWS would be certainly helpful. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll give you the backlog number. It grew 65% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s healthy, and we have the average contract length is over three years for our AWS contracts. I would say contract volume and negotiations are strong and have maintained through this period. So it is \u2013 that\u2019s a good sign. It really does boil down to short-term versus long-term incentives here for a lot of our customers. They\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re in an industry that\u2019s been heavily impacted by COVID in the economy, you\u2019re looking for ways to save money and you\u2019re trying to do a click and we\u2019re trying to help in that regard. And one of the best ways to save money long-term is to use the cloud, not only to turn it into a variable cost, it could be a fixed cost, but also to be able to take advantage of the partner network that we have, the security that we have and also the constant evolution of products and services that we bring to market.Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.Aaron Kessler: Great. A couple of questions. First, maybe just one of your competitors noted that growth was slowing in some markets that have opened up, I guess, probably more in Europe. Maybe just thoughts there. Are you seeing any changes in sort of the markets that are starting to open up? And just any commentary on the Zoox acquisition, how you kind of \u2013 can use that technology longer term as well? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: I imagine you mean on consumer business, countries opening up.Aaron Kessler: Correct.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Well, we still see strong demand. So I don\u2019t have any particular color on that regard by country. We do think probably the UK was very \u2013 grew very strongly in Q2, and that, I believe, is starting to moderate a bit but still stronger than normal. So I don\u2019t want to go by country, but I think those trends will start to perhaps become evident.", "220": " And then, Aaron, just on your second question on Zoox, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s not too much to say at this point. It\u2019s still pretty early, but I think it probably goes without saying it\u2019s a tremendously forward-thinking team, which resonates with us. And they really do kind of pioneer in that space, the ride-hailing space. So a lot of cool work they\u2019re doing, designing autonomous vehicles and focused on the passenger, right, in front of mind in that. So I think, again, just as we think about kind of the innovation components and commitments to solving kind of problems and challenges for customers, it\u2019s pretty exciting for us to be able to work with them and bring that vision to fruition in the years ahead.Operator: Our final question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post: Great. A couple of questions. Obviously, a great cost quarter on the leverage side. Any changes in e-commerce gross margins to call out? Is scale and getting size, improving gross margins or anything on the mix shift there that\u2019s interesting? And then secondly, we talked about a lot about one day investment last year. Obviously, the shipping times were impacted by COVID, but are you back to kind of normal times? And where are you on the one day investment? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. On one day, again, we\u2019re first prioritizing employee safety. We have a lot of effort in that regard. We\u2019ve changed over 150 process paths. We\u2019ve instituted social distancing, cleaning, temperature taking, both with our warehouse employees and also our transportation employees. So that\u2019s really still priority one. And second is capacity expansion, especially as we head into the second half of the year, which generally sees a step-up in volume even over the first half of the year. So we will \u2013 we are improving the percentage of one day. We\u2019re not back to where we were pre-COVID. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be back in the short run, but we will continue to improve it. And hopefully, it\u2019ll be less noticeable for our consumer base. On the gross margin side, it\u2019s very much a mixed bag right now.", "221": " Advertising was \u2013 and AWS were certainly a strong component of gross margin increases. Product mix could go either way depending on the country. But as this COVID has played out, consumables and grocery, which are lower margin, have started to \u2013 have been a negative impact on gross margin. But the \u2013 we feel good about where we are. Gross margin for the quarter was 40.8% and was down 200 basis points from last year. It\u2019s probably more tied to the addition of one-day shipping. And even if we didn\u2019t do as much one-day shipping as we\u2019ve been doing post COVID, the costs of one-day shipping are already built into our structure. We\u2019ve already reconfigured our network. We\u2019ve already created the capacity to be able to ship. It\u2019s just a matter of whether or not we can get it out through the warehouse and to you in one day or not.David Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.", "222": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the amazon.com Q2 2021 Financial Results, Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 29,2021, only, and will include Forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors. detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "223": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to first thank all of our Prime members, our vendors, our 3P sellers, and my Amazon colleagues, especially the Worldwide Ops team, for a record-breaking Prime Day in June. Third-party sellers, who are mostly comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, were a big contributor to Prime Day 's success. The Prime Day event was the biggest two-day period ever for these SMBs in our stores, and our 3P revenue continued to grow significantly faster than our online stores revenue. Third-party units represented 56% of our total paid units in Q2, up from a 53% mix one year ago. Our second quarter net sales were $113 billion or at about the midpoint of our guidance range. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 27% or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and included the shift of Prime Day into Q2 this year, which added about 400 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate. Q2 of this year was a transition period for many of our customers. As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the U.S. and much of Europe. As a result, while Prime members continued to spend more with us, growth in Prime members spend moderated compared to spending seen during the peak of the pandemic. As you look at our recent revenue growth rates, I want to give you some insight into what we are seeing as there have been some noticeable intra-quarter changes in our revenue run rate. Prime Day has also been in three different quarters the past three years, so I will normalize for this impact in my growth rate comments. Also since FX rates have bounced around, all of my comments exclude foreign exchange. Here\u2019s a quick recap of our growth rates in 2020 and 2021. First, before COVID-19, we've been growing at a revenue growth rate close to 20%.", "224": " Once the pandemic hit and lockdowns began in March 2020, the initial growth rate jumped into the mid-30% range. Q1 of last year ended with a revenue growth rate of 27%. However, our operations network took time to step up to serve this growth in demand due to space constraints and our need to ramp up hiring quickly while prioritizing employee health and safety. By mid-May of last year, we have made good progress to open up more capacity by adding hundreds of thousands of employees. This allowed our revenue growth rate to jump to the 35% to 45% range and remained at that level through Q1 of this year when we had 41% growth. In Q2 of this year, we began to comp this high sales period from last year, and the year-over-year revenue growth rate has narrowed. It has also narrowed as vaccines become more readily available in many countries and people are getting out of their homes. Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend. Given all this volatility, it is useful to consider the 2-year compounded annual growth rate, which remained strong in the 25% to 30% range. Recall, this compares to our pre-pandemic growth rate of 21%. This reflects the acceleration of Prime membership and Prime member purchase levels over the past 18 months. While I'm not giving forward guidance beyond Q3 of this year, we do expect this pattern of difficult year-over-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters. As we move forward and start to comp COVID 's impact on our revenue growth, we encourage you to also look at the multiyear compounded annual growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this growth in perspective. Now, back to the Q2 highlights. We continue to be very pleased with the Prime member growth and engagement we're seeing. We've been fortunate to welcome more than 50 million new members in the past 18 months, and Prime member benefits usage remains high. That includes continued strong engagement in Prime's family of digital offerings, like Prime Video's original movies. For example, Prime members helped make The Tomorrow War and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, the number one streaming movies on their respective opening weekends.", "225": " Other revenue increased 83% year-over-year in Q2, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven largely by continued acceleration in our ads business. Moving on to AWS, revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. We see strong growth in enterprises, governments, educational, and research institutions, and our start-up and digital native customers. We recently announced new commitments and migrations from customers across a diverse set of major industries, including Swisscom and Bell Canada in Telecom, BMO Financial Group, and Bancolombia in financial services, and Ferrari in automotive. AWS customers recognize that the move to the cloud is very positive for their businesses in the medium and long term. Disruptive economic events like COVID have caused many people to step back and think about how they want to change strategically, and many have come to the conclusion that they do not want to own and run their own datacenters. They assume they can save money and gain agility and innovation by moving to AWS. I'll finish up with some comments on our ongoing investments in operations. As we think about the pull-forward in demand we've seen these past 18 months, it has required and will continue to require a significant amount of investment in our fulfillment network. Our teams have done a remarkable job stepping up to serve customers and support our vendors and sellers, and we've worked hard to increase capacity at a rapid rate. For the trailing 12 months ended Q2, Capex and equipment finance leases increased 74% versus the prior trailing 12-month period. And as usual, most of our 2021 spend and building openings are planned in the second half of this year. This is all part of a multi-year investment cycle for us. Unit volumes, while obviously growing at lower rates of last year's large comp continue to remain high, and we see strong demand for FBA and third-party sellers. So, there's more work to do, including additional build-outs of our FCs, as well as our middle mile and last-mile capabilities to support our fast-improving delivery offers for customers. I encourage you to read the business highlights in our press release. It's a diverse collection of efforts supported by many thousands of customer-focused Amazon employees, from Amazon Pharmacy to Business Prime to to AWS' plans to add seven new regions to NFL Thursday Night Football starting next year, to the Black Business Accelerator program, to Alexa\u2019s collaboration with Ford Motor Company.", "226": " We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to Q&A.Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. [Operator instructions] Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just want to ask two, just going back to the 2Q revenue beyond Prime spend moderating and the reopening, is there anything else you'd point to, in particular, that they have kept you in the middle of the range versus obviously where you've been over the last year versus expectations? And I guess, in particular, can you talk about Prime Day relative to your expectations? And then secondly, the BigCommerce partnership, a couple weeks ago, you seem to have opened up more to working with merchants away from Amazon. Just hoping you could talk more about the multichannel fulfillment opportunity, and do you think you now have the logistics capabilities, and has everything recovered to the point where you can offer these services more to third parties? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Now as far as Q2 run rate is concerned, if you look back the last few quarters, we've not done a great job of nailing the impact of COVID. We have generally over-performed our guidance range. I think last quarter we had kept the same process coming off some very high volumes for the last prior four quarters. And really, the only difference I see is in Q2 versus Q1, and before is the year-over-year comp, which we had factored in, but also the increase in mobility. I think the impact of people getting vaccinated and getting out in the world, not only shopping offline, but also living life and getting out. It takes away from shopping time. It's good -- it's a good phenomenon and it's great, and we just have to appropriately gauge our run-rate going forward. So, Prime Day was very successful.", "227": " And again, I think it was a great day then for third-party sellers as I pointed out.Dave Fildes: Doug, on your second question, it's Dave here. I\u2019d just say our focus is really squarely on adding capacity to meet the current high customer demand that Brian talked about in his opening remarks. We're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support partners, SMBs in particular who sell on Amazon, and that includes testing shipping programs and newer initiatives that can help those businesses get packages to customers quickly and reliably. So, continue to see us look for ways to be able to innovate where it's appropriate relative to the customer demand we're already seeing in our network.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please, proceed with your question.Colin Sebastian: Thanks very much, guys. I guess sort of masked in the headline results is actually pretty solid performance in the higher margin segments of the business, including third-party services, subscriptions, AWS, and advertising. and then I think that was evident in gross margin as well. I guess my question is whether there is any deliberate shift towards these services or is that just more of an output of somewhat weaker trends you saw after mid-May? And then secondly, is Prime Day still a once per year phenomenon or would you consider separate events spread out during the same year to capitalize on different seasonal trends? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. On the second question, I don't have anything to announce today. Our trend has been once a year. Of course, it's moved between quarters the last three years. So, that's all I have on that one. As far as the higher-margin areas and whether that's a purposeful strategy, I'd like to say it is, but if you look at what they are third-party is kind of a continuation of strength in our FBA program, in particular, I think the sellers are doing a great job of adding additional selection that's very valuable and reinforces our flywheel, and we'd like to see that and you see that third-party percent of units went up from 53% last year to 56%, and that's a steady mark. We've seen that, as we said, the third-party sellers are doing a great job and we like to see that.", "228": " We have traffic coming in for the consumer business. And if we do a good job with advertising, we'll make it an additive experience for our customers and our sellers and vendors. So that's what we work on, is to make sure that it's a relevant experience and adds to your shopping experience and helps you find selection that perhaps you wouldn't have found otherwise or it would've been harder to. And then on AWS, AWS is again, its own separate part of the business. It has been 15 years in the development, and we think our scale and experience really pays dividends. If you looked at the last quarter, AWS set more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year than any quarter in our history. We are now at $59 billion annualized run-rate business, and that's up from 43 billion at this time last year. So, those are output measures as we like to say, the input measures are doing a good job on products, adding new capabilities, and being able to work with our customers to solve their problems. I think that's what you are seeing and it's matching up well with a renewed emphasis on getting to the cloud by a lot of companies out there. And when they're looking to make that transition, it's giving up control and putting yourself in -- and choosing a partner for the long haul, and we're proud that companies choose us for that journey.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I've two, one a little nitpicky and one kind of big picture. The nitpicky on, Brian, fulfillment on a per unit basis was pretty high in the second quarter given -- relative to normal seasonality. Can you talk about just what's driving that? Is that a new build, new square feet, or are there inefficiencies that went on in the quarter in fulfillment. And the second one is sort of about bigger picture. In the last quarter, you talked a little bit about same-day in Europe. There\u2019s been some headlines about same-day. How do we think -- how should we think about a larger same-day offering being part of the investment process right now, just to sort of maintain and grow your share of grocery and consumables?", "229": " Thanks. Yes, I would say on the fulfillment side, there are a number of things. First, we are adding a lot of capacity. If you step back, the Amazon fulfilled unit volume, so that's the units coming out of our fulfillment centers both retail and FBA have doubled in the past 2 years. And the AMZL, the delivery arm of our business, has more than doubled in that time period. So, you can see there's been very strong multiyear demand here that we're still catching up with from last year. So most of -- I mentioned earlier our year-over-year growth in CapEx and equipment leases is 74% in the second -- at the end of June compared to 38% the year before. So, we're continuing to add and most of that development is really ahead of us in the second half of the year. So, if you've been with us a long time, you know, the cadence is that as we add demand -- excuse me, as we add capacity, there's a lot of additional costs from hiring to starting up to training, to getting that building or sort center or delivery station up and running. It usually takes a multi-year period to tame those assets. And we've literally nearly doubled our network here in the last 18 months from a size standpoint. There's a lot of that going on, a lot of strong effort by our fulfillment and ops teams to help mitigate the costs. The other thing is wage pressure has become evident, we've talked about this a bit. The wage increase for -- that we normally would do in October, we pulled forward into May. We're spending a lot of money on signing and incentives. And while we have very good staffing levels, it's not without cost. It's very competitive labor market out there, and certainly the biggest contributor to inflationary pressures that we're seeing in business.Dave Fildes: Brian, on the second point just around speed, as we've talked about many times, customers respond well to the fast, high-quality delivery and of course, back in 2019, we were talking at that time about expanding the one-day delivery in the U.S. in the Europe, one-day delivery as part of Prime in most of those are sizable European countries where we operate has been standard for many years.", "230": " So as we [Indiscernible] here that work's not done yet. We're continuing to expand. You'll see that investment throughout 2021. And that growing transportation network will support faster delivery times for customers. One-day delivery is improving and -- in the U.S. as well as same-day delivery, where it makes sense and where the network is growing there. So we'll have to continue to see how we go, but we are focused on those data points. And we're also focused on improving delivery precision as a way of improving the quality of -- of the overall offering.Operator: Your next question comes from line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.Youssef Squali: Thank you very much. I have two questions. One, within online stores, was there any particular area of softness during the quarter? I'm just thinking about maybe some product categories that may have come back, or actually the opposite, may have gone down, the demand for with the reopening that you can maybe highlight. And then as you look beyond Q3 and Q4, what kind of growth assumptions for e-commerce or just in general for the next couple of years, are you guys working with to build your budget and events against the opportunity? I'm just thinking, are you guys assuming that e-commerce growth remains or it goes back to pre - COVID levels or stays at an elevated level, [Indiscernible] Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the online store's revenue. You're probably looking at a growth rate of 13% in Q2 versus the revenue growth -- FX-neutral revenue growth rate of 24%. I would point you back to last year in Q2. At that online stores grew 49%, there were restrictions on what we stocked in our warehouses. And as you remember, we had to constrain space for a lot third-party sellers as well as our retail offering. But the mix shifted for the early part of Q2 last year to be more of a retail mix and then MFN mix, and then it flip back to be more balanced mix that you've seen in the past. On forward investment, here's how I would explain it. Again, we are sitting here with demand volumes that have gone up on an Amazon Fulfilled Network basis.", "231": " So we are not back to where we want to be on a number of dimensions. We handled Q4 last year, we've been playing catch-up pretty much since the pandemic started. But what suffered is space and space constraints. And that's -- it's gotten better, but it was a factor last year. And also our one-day delivery percentage has dropped and has not returned to levels seeing pre-pandemic in the United States, It's on par and getting better than pre-pandemic in Europe. But in the United States, while it's improving, it still hasn't reached the pre-pandemic level. So we have a lot of growth to do there. As far as the stickiness of purchases. I think there's certainly a number of things that were purchased last year that didn't repeat for a lot of retailers. Things like consumables early on, gloves, cleaning supplies, computer monitors, some things you use to outfit your house. You can probably go through your own checklist of purchases and say, okay, I probably will not do this every year. But there has been a healthy movement to online commerce. We have -- we've added Prime members, and the Prime members that we have have ratcheted up their purchases with us, which was always part of the plan and a good sign. It means we're offering them more things that they can buy and satisfying more their demand needs. Even in Q2, when, and as I said, rates are starting to moderate, in the quarter, those Prime member purchases still grew year-over-year on a -- per Prime member basis they just didn't grow at the same cliff that they had in the prior 3 or 4 quarters. So that's a good sign. And we like the engagement levels and the retention levels that we see with Prime members. So all-in-all very positive story on that front has accelerated the model quite a bit. There's just, again, some comparison issues that we'll just have to realize and perhaps look at a 2-year compound annual growth rate for a period of time to judge where we are on that progress because there's been a lot of ins and outs, especially with Prime Day moving around. So hopefully that answers your question.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "232": " Brian, it seems like the pandemic has touched off what looks like a greater urgency among SMBs to accelerate their presence online, and I was wondering if your third-party marketplaces' platform is seeing perhaps a faster influx of more sellers or emerging brands. And following up on the labor market commentary there, do you think you will see any incremental headwinds hiring the necessary people for performance centers this year? Thanks.Dave Fildes: Stephen, it's Dave. I'll take that first question just around SMBs and behavior. I think, look, it's -- we've seen a 20-year progression in terms of building out the services that we thought were resonated with us and our business, but also saw very early on to externalize those services and offerings to sellers and particularly, small-medium size businesses over time. Obviously, noteworthy with FBA and many other features. And so I think this -- what you see is really just a continuation of that effort put out by the teams around, whether it's logistics, brand representation. More recently. in recent years with some of the advertising features, we've been able to develop surface, for all our selling partners. And so I think that's a big area and a big part of commitment. I don't know that I [Indiscernible] anything specifically in the near term other than to say that we should continue to see great momentum on a units basis as we give that metric every quarter, about 56% of our overall total paid units, are third-party. That's up about 300 basis points year-over-year. So, expect for us to continue to put forth that effort in FBA around the world. for sellers and some of these other SMB features continue to gain momentum there.Brian Olsavsky: And on the labor comment, we can't predict too far in the future. We've got labor estimate in our Q3 guidance, I would say it's a bit of a complicated mix of economic growth and industries opening up, government payments in some areas that may impact people's working, and then whether or not children are at back at school fully in the fall. So there's a lot of dynamics we do count on having more employees in Q3 and Q4, as you know, from our ramp up to the holidays.", "233": " Please proceed with your question.Ron Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on just international operating income. that's -- if you look at the results, it's now producing consistently positive results here. And so can you talk to us a little bit more? Just talk to us a little bit more about what's driving that. Is this the result of most major builds are now complete, and you're seeing the efficiencies in fulfillment centers, and so we should see this trend continue or is there something else that's driving international operating income? Just remaining positive here. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Ron, thanks for your question. Yes, we have had strong international results in the last five quarters or so. Noticeably, the positive operating income, which had not been the trend prior to Q2 of last year. I would say the major factors here are the acceleration of growth, so we've in some ways put the set 2 years out - growth on top of today's assets. That's a lot of stress, but it's a lot of leverage of the assets that we have. And as we've talked about before, our fulfillment centers and operations have been running pretty much at peak since May of last year. It's starting to mitigate a bit, but it's a strong undercurrent. But having said that, we continue to invest in international expansion. You may have noticed that we added Portugal as a Prime country last quarter. We have investments in Brazil, and India, and the Middle East and a number of countries. So we continue to add new countries. We have a strong performance in our more established countries like Europe and Japan. And so it's a bit of a mixed bag, but right now, again, the performance is very strong. The foreign exchange rate has been favorable as well last few quarters. So that has helped. But really pleased with the performance of our international teams. And we'll see again it -- our investment plans -- our plans are to make money, obviously in the long run. But we have forward advanced Prime benefits in a lot of these countries before they would have been able to see them.", "234": " Please proceed with your question.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. So maybe one on Amazon then a follow-up. So Amazon -- sorry, AWS. So you saw 10% sequential growth in the quarter, you saw that also in the fourth duarter, was there anything around reopening that made second quarter AWS exceptionally strong and that we should kind of keep in mind going forward, or do we feel like this was kind of a normal quarter for kind of AWS and this is a kind of a good cadence for the business. And then just a follow-up, just -- maybe your your point about the ability to kind of keep up. Is there any kind of throttling of FBA that's going on, just because you don't have the capacity or to -- or you are trying to say that you might be losing share to other sellers who can promise to get an item to customers faster, given still some of the challenges with logistics and last mile and everything. Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Hi, Jason. Thank you. Let me start with that second question. No, my comments were really about throttling of space last year which did impact -- it impacted our vendors and our retail business as well as our third-party business, probably more pronounced in Q2 of last year, especially April and into early May as we are working to get fully staffed in a help -- helpful and safe way, and also build out more capacity. In Q4, again, we're handling volumes that were somewhat unheard of year-over-year. Our Q4 growth rate was 42%. That's usually not the case, and it's magnified at peak when we're already handling the highest volumes of the year. All I was trying to say was that our space planning and if you will, throttling of space for their price was not something we like to do. We don't think we're the only ones who had that issue. And that's why we're building out our networks so quickly in our minds. It's hard to do quickly. but we're moving as quickly as possible. And again, we have a lot of new capacity being added in the second half of the year.", "235": " There's always a lot of year-over-year things going on, but we do note that last year there was a lot of effort by companies to limit their spend and operate more efficiently as as we're all plunged into an unknown demand curve and some industries who were hurt worse than others. If you remember, we worked -- we actually worked very hard with our customers to help them lower their demand for AWS services as best we could to match any new demand patterns. We also help [Indiscernible] scale very quickly. Companies like [Indiscernible], Netflix and others were very help -- glad that AWS was there to help them scale to meet volume very quickly, so there's a lot of mixed bag there. We think that it was a strong performance for this quarter. We can see good trends with new contracts and new clients that are either signing up with AWS and making the journey to the Cloud or accelerating their journey to the Cloud, or setting up new longer-term contracts with us.Operator: Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post: Great. A couple. No one's really mentioned the CEO change. So I was wondering if it is not on the call but any change in direction, investment philosophies, or any -- more integration of AWS, or anything that we should be aware of related to that change? And then second, AWS margins, really strong revenues. The margins came down quarter-over-quarter. Can you just remind us of what drives some of that margin fluctuation? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the second one. So again, at any point in time, there's a lot of cross pressures in the operating margins of AWS. There's growth which helps us leverage our assets. There's increasing the efficiency of our servers and efficiency of our sales force. Those are all positives. On the flipside, there's price decreases, there's new contracts signed with large players for multiple years. So there's pricing pressure. There's also the expansion of the sales force and building infrastructure to add new regions globally. So as we said, these margins are going to bounce around. We're happy with the Q2 margins. I would note that there was a negative impact from foreign exchange that was about 150 basis points.", "236": " We know it's going to bounce around as we invest, but also worked very hard to scale our businesses in and efficiently run our assets. on the leadership change. It's your -- expect Andy, he's hit the ground, running. He's continuing to have a very high bar for customer experience. high standards, operational excellence, inventiveness, willingness to fail, and everything else that Amazon is known for internally and externally. I think we've had a good handoff. Jeff, of course, is moving into Executive Chairman role and he will not be leaving. He is obviously continuing to be very involved in, as we say, the 1-way door decisions. We've also had a good leadership change at AWS with Adam Selipsky coming in. Adam himself comes with a lot of Amazon history and knowledge and external CEO experience that has made him even stronger as he comes back. So we feel really good about the transition. And of course, don't expect any drop and expect Andy to add his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism in forward-looking focus to help Amazon keep going and delighting customers.Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least 3 months.", "237": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC.", "238": " It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thanks for joining today's call. Before we get the questions, I'll make some comments about our Q2 performance and the outlook for Q3. Let's start with Q2. During the quarter, we saw improvement in many of our key operational metrics, including in-stock levels and delivery speed and saw a subsequent step-up in consumer demand. For the quarter, worldwide net sales of $121.2 billion exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range and represented an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding approximately 320 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was a larger foreign exchange headwind than the 200 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q2 guidance. As a reminder, our revenue growth accelerated to over 40% growth from the period between May 2020 and May 2021. While demand has remained strong, the lapping of this high growth period, depressed our revenue growth rate for the following 12 months ending in May of this year. Our growth rates going forward will no longer require this historical explanation. Q2 of last year was also when vaccines had become more available, particularly in the United States and we began to see more normal shopping patterns. Prime Day also occurred in Q2 last year and contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. This year's Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. As the impacts of the last two years are normalizing, we are happy with how we've served customers and how they have responded. Our compound annual growth, since the start of the pandemic, stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we are seeing prior to the pandemic. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic. Over that period, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. We continue to improve the customer experience in Q2, including quarter-over-quarter improvements in delivery speed and inventory in stock levels. We have also moved quickly to adjust our staffing levels and improve the efficiency of our significantly expanded operations network.", "239": " While there's still work to be done, we've made good progress in Q2. Our Prime membership program remains a key driver of our worldwide stores business, and we continue innovating to make the membership even more useful and valuable. That includes the upcoming premier of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on September 2 and exclusive access to NFL Thursday Night Football games starting September 15. Our seller community also had a strong Q2. Third-party sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2, the highest percentage ever. Selling partners helped to expand the selection we can offer customers while fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery. Operating income was $3.3 billion in the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range. Last quarter, I discussed several cost pressures facing our worldwide stores business; inflationary costs, fulfillment network productivity, and fixed cost deleverage. Recall that these amounted to approximately $6 billion of incremental costs in Q1 when compared to Q1 2021. We've made solid progress in reducing these costs. For the second quarter, incremental costs were in line with our expectations at approximately $4 billion when compared to Q2 2021. Inflationary pressures remained at elevated levels in Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1. These include pressures from higher fuel, trucking, air and ocean shipping rates, which we expect will continue into Q3. We made strides to improve fulfillment network productivity in Q2. Staffing levels were more in line with rising Q2 demand, and we saw better optimization of our fulfillment network. On the transportation side, we've continued to improve delivery route density and improve package deliveries per hour. We are encouraged by the progress during the quarter and see opportunity to further improve in the second half of the year. Lastly, the year-over-year negative impact of fixed cost leverage was relatively consistent with Q1. There are two main drivers when talking about fixed cost leverage. First is the unfavorable comparison to very high holiday level utilization rates that we saw in the first half of 2021. And second is the normal step down in volumes off of our Q4 peak that we saw in first half of 2022. On the first point, we expect this challenging year-over-year comp will have ended in Q2.", "240": " We've also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions. Let's turn to AWS. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in AWS, where net sales were $19.7 billion in Q2, up 33% year-over-year, and now represented an annualized sales run rate of nearly $79 billion. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and we believe we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. We see great opportunity to continue to make investments on behalf of AWS customers. We continue to invest thoughtfully in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, while expanding AWS to new regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, British Telecom, and Jefferies' Investment Bank to name a few announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. AWS operating income was $5.7 billion in Q2. As a reminder, this includes a portion of our seasonal Q2 step-up in stock-based compensation expense. AWS results include a greater mix of these costs, reflecting wage inflation in high demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers as well as increasing technology infrastructure investment to support long-term growth. Now let's talk about capital investments. As usual, we will discuss the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2021, we incurred approximately $60 billion in capital investments. About 40% of that is comprised of technology infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS as well as our worldwide stores business. Another 30% of the $60 billion was fulfillment capacity and a little less than 25% was for transportation, remaining 5% was comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full-year 2022, we do expect to spend slightly more on capital investments than last year, but the proportion of capital spending shifts among our businesses. We expect technology infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, primarily to support the rapid growth in innovation we are seeing with AWS. We expect infrastructure to represent a bit more than half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the worldwide stores business, we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with customer demand.", "241": " Finally, I'd highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $2 billion in the second quarter, while we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $3.9 billion, which is included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. In the U.S., we've started making customer deliveries using the Rivian electric delivery vehicles. This rollout is the start of what we expect to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of the year and 100,000 vehicles across the U.S. by the year 2030. Additionally, note that all of our share and per share information included in our financial materials has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split, which was effective on May 27th. We also provided our third quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. Again, a reminder that this year, our Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. Prime Day occurred in Q2 in 2021. For revenue, note that our guidance includes an estimated approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates. The estimated FX impact to operating income is not significant. Our third quarter operating income guidance range is zero to $3.5 billion. This compares to Q2 operating income of $3.3 billion. This third quarter guidance assumes, we see approximately $1.5 billion in quarter-over-quarter sequential cost improvement in our fulfillment network operations, which we expect will be largely offset by investments in AWS and additional digital content for Prime members. For AWS, this quarter-over-quarter increases are primarily driven by higher infrastructure investments to support continued strong customer growth, including larger depreciation on a growing fixed asset base. We also expect increased energy costs as we continue to see volatility in utility prices around the world and operating our AWS data centers. Quarter-over-quarter increase in digital content primarily relates to new Prime Video content in Q3, including Thursday Night Football and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. Thank you. And now let's move on to your questions.Operator: At this time, we'll now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "242": " Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Brian, I wanted to just talk a little bit about the bridge from 2Q to 3Q EBIT guide a little bit. It sounds like you're going to have revenue up nicely. You talked about the efficiencies of the $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and some of the incremental investments in content, et cetera. Where are the other areas where you're sort of investing more to grow and is any of that associated with merchandise margin or step-ups in discounting? That would be the first one. And the second one is kind of going back to your comment about you \u2013 how you've slowed 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans. How should we think about the fulfillment and transportation CapEx sort of looking into the fourth quarter into next year? How far ahead of this build have you gone through for the last, call it, nine months? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with your second question. So in any particular year when we're spending capital, a good portion of it, we estimate about 40% this year is being spent in support of warehouses or transportation capacity. That will be opening up and effective in 2023 and beyond. So there's always a pre-spend to keep the \u2013 again, the pipeline moving. So when we make adjustments to the time horizon, the impact is not as great as you might expect in the year 2022. Again, we have moved things out and capital is coming down in those areas as we just mentioned. We'll just have to keep you posted as we go quarter-to-quarter on what our expectations are. On the bridge to Q2 to Q3, so again, you have the \u2013 mentioned three items, ops improvement that we see of a $1.5 billion and offsetting that is increased costs in AWS, as we build out depreciation. We also are adding \u2013 continuing to add people in that space; product engineers, salespeople, customer support. Speaking more broadly, we know AWS is a huge opportunity to early days in the adoption curve for companies and governments. And we invest with that - with that confidence in mind and customers have responded and we're going to keep investing there.", "243": " Our macroeconomic issues are principally on inflation and pretty transparent on that. I think the new thing this quarter is additional pressure on the energy, electricity rates in our data centers because of the ramp up in natural gas prices, if you've seen that. So that's probably the new information and then the other inflationary factors. Well, some of them are coming down slightly. They're still significantly a penalty year-over-year. Other cost pressures are principally on our cost of employees. If you look at our stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, it's gone up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter, as we stepped up from Q1 to Q2. We see that pattern every year, but we don't see that magnitude and that's where a lot of our wage inflation is for particularly our technical employees. So there's a certain amount of conservatism always built into this because we are in a very difficult macroeconomic state potentially. Again, we're not seeing it hit our businesses directly. In fact, we're seeing strong growth in sales through the quarter in Q2. But we're cognizant that things could change quickly and we'll see and monitor and that's how we set our forward guidance.Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Douglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I wanted to ask about AWS. Some of your peers in the cloud space have talked about some slowdown in booking rates just as customers take longer to work through deal terms and duration. So if you could comment on whether AWS is seeing similar dynamics? And then also when you think about margins, the 35% for AWS in 1Q going to 29% in 2Q, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about going forward just given decreasing server life benefits and tougher macro environment? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. I'll start with second question. So on margins in AWS, yes, as you mentioned that is dropping sequentially. The margin rate is going to fluctuate and this business is going to be always a factor of new investment and things like the sales force and new regions and infrastructure capacity offset by infrastructure efficiency gains that we see.", "244": " We're very happy with the growth rate. We're happy with the adoption of the cloud. As you hit a potential rough patch in the economy, I think the last time we saw this was back in 2008-ish. And it\u2019s hard to draw lessons from that, but we did notice that it did help our cloud business at the time because again, when you're trying to launch a new product or service and you have to face with building your own data center and getting capital for a data center and building it yourself or moving to the cloud and essentially buying incremental infrastructure capacity, the cloud computing really shows its value. So we're prepared \u2013 just like when the slowdown in 2020, we are prepared to help customers optimize their costs and will help them any who are scaling down. But we'll also, again, continue to find new customers and new industries including government agencies and happy with that. And if you look again, where our investments been over the last few years and the growth of our sales force and our sales support, it's starting to \u2013 it is showing benefits, and we expect that to continue. On your \u2013 sorry, your other question was, is that\u2026Douglas Anmuth: Just about current trends in terms of booking rates\u2026Brian Olsavsky: Got it. I blended into one answer.Douglas Anmuth: Yes, you blended that.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Hopefully that covered what you\u2019re asking about.Douglas Anmuth: Yes, it does.Brian Olsavsky: Doug, just to \u2013 I mean, just to pile on to that too. I mean, I think just the longer term vision I probably talked about here, we're right now with 84 availability zones. So that's 26 geographic regions, and we've got plans for \u2013 to launch 24 more of those availability zones across eight regions. And this is Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, so a lot of different spots. And so continuing to focus on building out to customers, working on that pipeline and building longer commitments, making \u2013 finding customers that are making longer commitments is really important to that.", "245": " So it's at about 3.9 years on a weighted average remaining life basis. So again, a lot of good work, a lot of still good opportunity out there to come, and as Brian talked about, we're working hard in many facets and investing in that to make sure we're in good position to serve folks.Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two-parter on the advertising business, where you saw continued strength. Is there any way to give us an update of how much of the advertising services line at this point is driven by North America e-commerce versus international e-commerce, and how you think about the relative growth rates and advertising going forward between North America and international? And the second part would be away from the e-commerce-driven parts of advertising. How are you feeling about the positioning and the investments you need to make around things like Connected TV and programmatic advertising, where from the outside in it looks like you're continuing to make greater levels of investment and increasing your exposure to a wider array of advertising products? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Great. Hi, Eric. Thanks for your questions. I would say on the geographic split, we haven't broken that out. The majority of advertising revenue is in North America, but having said that, we are making great strides in international as well. And we're also, as you mentioned, expanding our array of advertising products from our consumer websites to video opportunities, Twitch and others. Dave, do you want to take the second part of that?Dave Fildes: Yes. I think it was \u2013 Eric, it was a question around kind of interactive work. I mean, we've got \u2013 one of our main priorities is building relevant and engaging ad experiences. And so, we of course, introduced interactive ads last year for streaming video content, things like Freevee. We've got Amazon Music as ad supported tier as well for audio ads. So looking for opportunities like that, where customers can more easily engage with brands while streaming content.", "246": " So things that are ongoing we've talked about around Freevee, around Twitch, and then of course, some things we're obviously excited about it. Thursday Night Football and Amazon streaming TV ads capabilities that we're going to continue to work with these partners and work with our own kind of technology capabilities to keep building out.Brian Olsavsky: Eric, I'd just add a little more on advertising because you're probably wondering again about softness \u2013 potential for softness in that or macroeconomic factors. Right now, we still see strong advertising growth. Again, it's got be a positive both for the customer and for the brand. I think our advantage is that we have highly efficient advertising. People are advertising at the point where customers have their credit cards out and are ready to make a purchase. It's also very measurable. And when people are looking, companies are looking to potentially streamline or optimize their advertising spend, we think our products compete very well in that regard. In addition to maybe longer term things like brand building and brings new selection to bear in front of customers.Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. If I can ask two. So you called out just the 3P mix being a kind of highest level, maybe talk about your focus to increase the mix to 3P and how that fits into plans for improved efficiency? And then secondly, on international, how much of the weakness in the margin sequentially was FX-driven? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Let me start on your first one. So challenge the premise is a little bit there about incenting mix, sorry, I believe that is how I interpreted your question. We are relatively indifferent as to whether some customer buys a third-party or first-party product from us. We're all about obviously is price selection and convenience. And 3P particularly helps us with selection. And when it's part of FBA can also help as being more Prime eligible and available to ship in one, two days or whatever the Prime offer happens to be. So we're happy with the selection that we've added from third-party sellers. And I think that shows in the percentage mix that you see. We're proud of the investment we've made to build tools and products that allow sellers to be successful on our site.", "247": " Sellers and vendors are also some of our larger advertising customers as well and helps \u2013 that advertising helps them surface new selection to our customer base. So it's a very strong partnership and it's been getting stronger. And I think you'll see also that they had a very big part in our Prime Day earlier this month.Dave Fildes: Yes. Jason, on your second question related to the international and the profitability there, reported there's a foreign exchange exposure there on that segment with the operating income, there's included in there about $231 million of unfavorable impact to that segment included in that $1.7 billion loss for the quarter. Just looking \u2013 broadly speaking at what's going on with that business and the losses that we're seeing there in the investments, I think it's important to remember it's early in many of our international countries, particularly in some of our emerging or more recent launch countries, places like India, Brazil, the Middle East, there are others as well, of course, but where we've been operating in many of those cases considerably shorter than the tenure we've had in the U.S. In our established international locations, UK, Germany, Japan, over time, we've continued to improve the profitability of that business as we build out and established stronger customer relationships and work on the cost structure and how we serve folks. A lot of that, of course, is driving improvements through our key pillars with price selection and convenience and working with vendors on commercial terms. In our emerging locations, there's a healthy amount of investment we've done to drive expansion. And we expect to continue to do that, given the strong competition across many of these markets and that's investments in Prime Video, not just in some of the flagship shows that are kind of sourced here in the U.S., but also you've seen us continue to push for opportunities for in-country and local language the video content that resonates with customers and can be a meaningful reason people sign-up for the Prime program, engage and renew. And we're also investing depending on the regions and kind of the local infrastructure [indiscernible], whether it's building out payment methods, third-party transportation services, even in some cases, the Internet and the telecom infrastructure. So we're playing a role along with others.", "248": " So those are some of the opportunities and challenges that you think about kind of where we are in the U.S. versus international that are out there. The network complexities, of course, there are some regulatory hurdles and other differences out there. But we think it's important to continue to invest in those opportunities and learn from what we're \u2013 not just in what we've done in the history with the U.S., but also in many of these countries and keep that flywheel spinning and continue to serve customers in more efficient ways.Operator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.Youssef Squali: Great. Thank you. I have two questions. One, can you discuss the impact, the price action you took on Prime, on merchant fees, et cetera, had on retention during the quarter, and do you feel that that's enough to offset the inflationary pressure we're seeing to date? And then on Buy with Prime, I know it's early, but how do you see the rollout of this initiative from it being by invitation only today to all merchants using FBA to \u2013 Amazon merchants, et cetera, and just kind of the implications on \u2013 broader implications on the business from that initiative? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you, Youssef. So first on the \u2013 let's take them one at a time. So on the Prime fee increase earlier in the year, we're happy with the results we're seeing in the Prime program. Prime membership and retention is still strong. I think that change has been above our expectations positively. And I think the benefit of the program continues to get better and better. And as I mentioned in-stocks never been higher, delivery speed is increasing. So not to mention a lot of the new content, especially on the video side that will be coming in the fall. So we feel good about the program and the state of the Prime members after a very rough couple years of pandemic turmoil. And we think it's good base to build upon. So on the seller fee again, we added that fee grudgingly in May to compensate for some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. I don't want to give you the idea that either of those fee increases came close to covering our costs.", "249": " And it\u2019s \u2013 we've got to work our way out of the condition we are in and we are making good progress in Q2 and expect to keep pressing on that in the second half of the year, but saw strength in the seller results in Q2, as we mentioned on the percentage mix. So I think, seller business remain strong in an integral part of our customer offering.Dave Fildes: Youssef, this is Dave. On your Buy with Prime question, yes, I mean, right now, it's allowing U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants on the online stores. And it's what they experience, they expect and kind of come to expect with Amazon that's the fast free delivery that seamless checkout and the free returns on orders that are eligible. Right now the program is available, as you mentioned, invitation-only for merchants that are already using FBA. And it'll expand throughout this year as we'll extend more merchants to invite and participate in the program. We're interested in learning and working with FBA sellers that we've known and had good trust with, but also expanding. And I think as you think about it, merchants, they obviously have a lot of choices on where they're going to sell products. And we have a long history of empowering and helping merchants. We've invested a lot in tools and capabilities, and of course, the delivery capabilities and all the things that go along with that. But that's an opportunity for us to support merchants who may or may not be FBA sellers with the tools and the opportunity just to sell their products online and scale their business and build their brand. And so I think I\u2019m really excited about, of course, getting to be able to launch this program over the last few months and dialing it up for more sellers as the year progresses.Operator: Our final question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.Stephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So Brian, I think you just reported a quarter-on-quarter decline on headcount, which was by design after what happened last quarter, but it won't be too long before you are gearing up for the holidays. So how do you think the environment is going to fair for you to be adding headcount?", "250": " So is this a matter of not hitting the hiring goals you were hoping for, or do you think the environment for the hiring of technical and engineering talent is losing up a little bit? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Stephen. Thank you. On the headcount, yes, I think it was more as we mentioned last quarter \u2013 last year \u2013 excuse me, in Q1, we added \u2013 to give you a flavor for it, we added 14,000 workers in Q1, prior year we had reduced our net headcount by 27,000. So we\u2019re pretty transparent about the fact that we had hired a lot of people in Q1 for the coverage of the Omicron variant, luckily that variant subsided and we were left with a higher headcount position that has come down through adjusting our hiring levels and normal attrition and \u2013 was pretty much resolved by the end of April or early part of May. So that is dominating the quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount. I would note that we're still up 188,000 year-over-year and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020. So you're right, there will be adjustments to that as we move forward into more holiday level demand. Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce, maybe we see good hiring rates. And so I think as you remember, there was a very difficult labor period in the second half of last year, and it didn't arrived kind of quickly out of nowhere. So we're certainly diligent on that and making sure we have a good workplace and an environment that will attract employees.Dave Fildes: And Stephen on your \u2013 just to your question on stock-based comp, as you mentioned, we do utilize restricted stock units or RSU as our primary mode of equity compensation. And as we always remind you, employee annual RSU grants do occur in the second quarter. And as a result, we typically see a step-up in the SBC expense from Q1 to Q2 and of course, you saw it this time around. The growth in the line is impacted overall also on the step-up by continued headcount. We've grown our workforce over the last few years.", "251": " In terms of the coming in at the five \u2013 little over $5 billion for stock-based comp, the main driver there was primarily driven by fewer employees stock awards vested \u2013 excuse me, fewer employee stock awards we\u2019re vesting in Q2 than we expected.Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again, next quarter.Operator: This concludes today's conference call.", "252": " Executives: Cindy McCann - Global Vice President, Investor Relations Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director Glenda Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations Jim Sud - Executive Vice President, Growth & Business Development A.C.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. But later, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Cindy McCann, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Cindy McCann - Global Vice President, Investor Relations: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call are John Mackey and Walter Robb, Co-Chief Executive Officers; A.C. Gallo, President; Glenda Flanagan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Sud, Executive Vice President of Growth & Development; and David Lannon and Ken Meyer, Executive Vice Presidents of Operations. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed today. This may be due to a variety of factors, including the risks outlined in our company's most recently filed Form 10-K. Please note our press release and scripted remarks are available on our website. We will discuss our Q3 comparable store sales growth results excluding the 95 basis point negative impact from the Easter shift and Team Member Double Discount Day. Also, please note our results include an $8 million expense, or 21 basis points related to the implementation of California's new paid sick leave law.", "253": " Good afternoon, everyone. I will briefly review the quarter and focus most of my time today on our outlook going forward. Year-over-year, our quarterly sales grew $255 million to a record $3.6 billion. We opened eight new stores, increasing our operating square footage 11% to 16 million and expanding our reach to 422 stores across 41 states and three countries. On an adjusted basis, comparable store sales increased 2.2% for the quarter, moderating 90 basis points from Q2. We estimate that the negative impact from cannibalization was 30 basis points greater in Q3 than in Q2. Comps improved 20 basis points from the last nine weeks of Q2 to the first 10 weeks of Q3, driven primarily by a 70-basis-point improvement in traffic, which was partially offset by a 50-basis-point decrease in basket size. We attribute the moderation in basket size primarily to our value efforts and to cost deflation in a few key volume product categories, including produce. Comps dropped sharply in week 11, after our New York City weights and measures audit received national media attention, and averaged just 0.4% for the last two weeks of the quarter. We have seen a slight improvement in trends fourth quarter to date; however, comps are still well below our 2.5% average for the 19 weeks prior to the negative publicity. We believe increasing headwinds are also a factor as sales begun to stabilize in the last few weeks of Q3 last year. I want to take a moment to address the New York City weights and measures audit. As soon as the New York Department of Consumer Affairs came to us, we worked to understand and address the issues to prevent them from happening again. I want to emphasize, these were not systematic, but rather caused by inadvertent human error. The audit included errors that were favorable to customers as well. These are weights and measures issues that can be found in any supermarket. Clear and transparent pricing is integral to how we operate. We have taken immediate steps to address these issues including improving our training regarding in-store packing, weighing and labeling processes and expanding our third-party auditing process company-wide. We built our business on the core value of satisfying and delighting our customers. It is what our customers have grown to love and expect from us, and our approach to pricing transparency is no different.", "254": " Turning back now to our results, gross margin, ex-LIFO, decreased 66 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. Our results reflect our more aggressive efforts to improve our price relevancy as well as higher shrink in the last two weeks of the quarter, given that purchases were planned for a higher level of sales heading into the 4th of July holiday. SG&A increased 24 basis points to 28.4% of sales against a record low in the prior year, due primarily to higher depreciation as a percentage of sales. Results included 21 basis points in expense related to the implementation of California's new paid sick leave law. Despite lower-than-expected sales, we maintained our labor expense disciplines and leveraged wages. Our new store class, for the last eight quarters, has averaged 38 stores with sales per gross square foot of approximately $700, translating to productivity levels of 78% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than two years old have averaged 15% comps and, most importantly, a 13% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered 9.7% EBITDA margin, $287 million of operating cash flow and a 15% return on invested capital. Year-to-date, we have produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $990, over $1 billion in EBITDA, and $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we have self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning over $325 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness towards fresh, healthy foods. With 424 stores totaling more than 16 million square feet today, we expect to cross the 500-store mark in fiscal year 2017, and over the longer term, continue to see potential for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. As announced last quarter, we are introducing a second format, 365 by Whole Foods Market, which we believe expands our growth opportunity beyond the 1,200 stores. While more streamlined than a typical Whole Foods Market store, our 365 stores will be guided by the same industry-leading quality standards.", "255": " 365 President, Jeff Turnas, is building a top-notch team and has hit the ground running. We are excited today to announce leases for the five 365 stores in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Portland, Houston, and Bellevue, Washington. These are all A+ real estate sites, which meet our required EVA hurdle return. We are currently targeting up to five 365 store openings in the second half of next calendar year, with the expectation of doubling that number of openings in calendar 2017. With opportunities in new and existing, as well as urban and suburban markets, most of our first stores are expected to be in the existing markets to better leverage our existing team member base and infrastructure. Our first 365 by Whole Foods Market store is scheduled to open in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where we converted a lease in development from Whole Foods Market to 365. Los Angeles is the perfect dense, urban market where customers already love our quality standards and transparency to introduce our latest evolution focused on quality food and value in a convenient format. We're excited to reveal more as things develop. Turning now to our outlook for Q4, we have opened two new stores and expect to open eight additional stores, including one relocation. If current comp trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 7% and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.35. This outlook reflects current trends as well as some headwinds from moderating inflation, increased cannibalization, and our own value efforts. For the fiscal year, this translates to sales growth of approximately 9%, with comps in the low-single digits and square footage up 10%. We continue to expect EBITDA margin of approximately 9% and ROIC greater than 14%. For the next fiscal year, we are forecasting ending square footage growth of approximately 9%, or 7.5% growth on a weighted square footage basis, reflecting a back-end loaded store opening schedule. We will provide additional details on our outlook next quarter. In summary, in this retail marketplace, which is more dynamic and competitive than ever, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to position ourself for the long-term. While we acknowledge it is taking longer than we would have hoped, we believe continuing to invest in our price relevancy, our marketing and our technology is the right strategy to regain the sales momentum.", "256": " We are committed to investing in marketing to support our value efforts, as well as our brand and are excited by a new brand campaign this fall. Year-to-date, we have made progress on our digital and technology efforts to better serve our customers. We are live with both Workday for all our team members, have launched our new iOS and Android mobile apps, refreshed our web experience, and are testing and evolving an affinity program. While still in the early stages, we have also piloted our new OnePOS and kiosk ordering for food venues and are rolling out labor scheduling to our customer service teams. We will continue to build out and enhance these efforts next year while also beginning to mobilize our new product platform, which will bring us many new exciting capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, space planning and price optimization. We remain focused on innovating and evolving to best serve our customers' diverse purchasing preferences in this rapidly changing marketplace. From the unique experience of our Whole Foods Market stores to the growing online channel for home delivery, to the exciting launch of our 365 by Whole Foods Market stores, we are leaning in to extend our reach to new as well as existing customers. We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. So, please, if you can, limit yourself to one question at a time so everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you.Operator: We'll take our first question from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT: Thanks. Good afternoon. Walter, when you look at the slowdown over the past five weeks, I guess, how can you guys be so precise that the New York audit is the primary factor? And I guess, more importantly, what steps are you taking to fix the problem given that it seems like it's bled into the first few weeks here of the fourth quarter?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Chuck. Well, again, I think in the comments here, we said that we \u2013 look, we try to give you the evidence in the chart there that showed the breakdown of the quarter, the weeks and the quarter, the end of the quarter, the start of the quarter, and the start of the new quarter to help you get some visibility into the impact of it. Clearly, it affected the comps.", "257": " But by any measure, it has significant impact on our sales. And with respect to the second part of your question, we've already taken the steps to \u2013 again, this was in nine of our New York City stores, to upgrade the training processes right away, to bring in a third party firm to audit our procedures and results and improve those and those steps have already been taken and in fact, we've been inspected subsequent times since without incident. So, all those things are already in place.Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT: Has the New York City store started to bounce back at all or are you still facing the pressures?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're not \u2013 I mean we're not really providing that level of detail as to the sales at this point, but I would say that \u2013 yeah, Glenda, maybe you want to...Glenda Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I just want to say that the impact was really felt across the whole country, not in New York City. This was national news. So, looking at what's happening in the New York market is really not the right way to look at it. It's looking at it across the whole company and you can see that for the first three weeks in Q4, although we've seen a little bit of uptick from there, it's still pretty low.Operator: Okay. And we can take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please go ahead.Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I guess I would like to follow on Chuck's questions. The question isn't just how you get your people to do the right thing, because clearly you've done that. The question is how do you change customer perception that somehow Whole Foods can't be trusted?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean I think that's a really fair question, Meredith. And then there's no \u2013 we're taking all the steps you can trust, has to be a trust is broken, it has to be rebuilt a step at a time and through solid, solid execution day in and day out.", "258": " Every store now has the customer pledge at the register letting them know that if you have any concerns, I'll ask and we'll recheck and if you're dissatisfied, we'll give it back to you, whatever. So all those things are in place and I think it's just a matter of sawing wood and doing the good work day in and day out to continue to rebuild that trust.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Meredith, John here. We don't think our track record is any different than any other supermarket. We're not sure why Whole Foods was singled out for this attention, and we don't know why the media ran wild with this. Our error rates are very small. We've done our own auditing, we've put in procedures now so that we can perhaps be perfect. But we believe in objective evaluation. If you compare Whole Foods record, these are inadvertent errors and there's no systematic mistakes being made here. It's a very small percentage of our total product. It's just something that went viral in the media, and it has hurt our trust and yet, we do feel like we're victims of \u2013 we don't know exactly why the DCA went after Whole Foods like this, and we're not sure why the media went crazy with it, but it did happen. We are taking steps to not give cause for this in the future. As far as re-establishing trust with our customers, there's no magic wand we can wave. We're going to do third-party audits, we're going to show that, we're going to be transparent about it and hopefully over time, the basic integrity of our company and the good customer service we provide will put this in the past and we'll move on past it.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David and I'll just say we're very encouraged by the results of our third party audits. We're doing them across the country, not just on New York but everywhere and we're passing audit after audit, we're eliminating the few errors we do find and our team members are really active about this because they want to do right by their neighbors and their customers and we're all over it.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.", "259": " You can see, as Glenda said, it's too early but it does \u2013 there is some hope that we're going back in the other direction now and we will \u2013 the additional steps we're taking, the bigger picture here to rebuild the sales momentum of the company, which is in our pricing efforts, our marketing efforts, our technology and platform efforts, all those things continue and to continue to do that and we do have our initial brand campaign coming this fall which again is an effort to kind of highlight what the company is all about and remind people what's different about Whole Foods Market.Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you for those answers.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.Operator: And we can take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the color on the new 365 format. So I just had a couple questions. I guess the 30,000 square foot size seems a little larger than I would have thought. And you did indicate in the prepared remarks that there'll be A+ locations. So I guess with that type of location, how do you get comfortable that you can maintain your ROIC because obviously price points will be lower and rents seem like they're going to be in line with what you're paying at your Whole Foods format. And then I guess, the four markets that you've indicated you're going to open, obviously, you've also told us some rationale from that. But there are obviously, I guess, close to existing Whole Foods stores. So, how do you think about the risk of cannibalization?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Karen, John here. We actually think we'll get superior ROICs with the 365 format. We're going to have significantly reduced capital investments, as well as significantly lower labor costs. And of course, we don't know until we actually open some stores. But when we project this out, if we get anything close to what Whole Foods Market sales per square foot are in our new stores, the 365 stores are going to be incredibly profitable, and with very high ROICs, even with reduced gross margins. Will there be some cannibalization of Whole Foods? I mean probably.", "260": " It'll probably be less than when we open up an actual branded Whole Foods Market store, because it's going to appeal to a little bit different customer, we think. So it is an experiment. We do have five stores committed and we have several other stores we are negotiating leases on. And a year from now we're going to have a lot more data for you, because we'll have some stores open, we'll see what they're doing, we'll see what the effects are, we'll see what our ROICs are. All I can say is we're super excited about it. We think we're going to have great stores, good locations, low gross margins, low labor, low capital investments and very high returns on invested capital. So...Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: One other point I want to make is, with 365, we look at it as an and, and we feel like it's very complementary to being in the area of a Whole Foods that customer has choices between going into a 365 or a Whole Foods depending upon the time and what they want to accomplish with the shop. And so we're hoping that it captures both of their choices when they decide to go out and shop. So if we look at the cannibalization, we think it's going to be lower, but we also are really encouraged by the chance that we have to capture more trips that the customer would have shopping.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, go ahead, David.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. Just \u2013 Ken and I have been working really hard on the \u2013 really excited about the Silver Lake design. I think one of your questions was about the size difference, say, between 25k to 30k and we're staying disciplined about what we're going to do with the 365 model. But we have this concept we're calling Friends of 365 where we're actually talking to interesting local suppliers that might rent out a small part of the space. So, again, our core store will be somewhere between 25 to 30, but we're also looking at opportunities to work with some local suppliers to give it some local flavor as well.Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And just one clarification on the wage and pay structure.", "261": " It's a simpler design, so the operational processes are going to be different and more simple so the labor structure will reflect that.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: And at some point, we could probably eventually tell you about the head count difference between the Whole Foods and this store as we get closer. But there's just going to be a lot less team members that are going to be more generalist whereas at big Whole Foods, there's a lot more specialists.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: But we're going to provide a lot more detail as we go forward on that, Karen, as we nail it down and get closer to the opening, we'll be able to give you a lot more specifics about the spend and about the business model structure as well. I think one of the things on the Silver Lake is just that we did convert an existing store. So, that's one reason why you can use the premise (20:58) of 365 to expand into that additional space. So...Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I had two questions related to the price investments. Maybe first, in terms of your gross margin decline during the quarter, maybe you can help us understand what portion of that decline was due to price investments, and what portion was related to shrink?Glenda Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, this is Glenda. If you look at the 66 basis points, there was probably about a third of that that was shrink in the quarter and the rest of it was the price investments.Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. And then, as you look at the price investments that took place during the quarter, was that planned throughout the year?", "262": " It's something we've been doing throughout the year and it's continuing to build up. So, this is the clearest indication of the price investments we're making.Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. And also just to follow up on the price investments, can you give any further color in terms of, are they coming from an expanded number of SKUs or is it more heavier cuts from still the relatively same select base? Can you give any color around that?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yes, hi. Well, we've been \u2013 I would say it's a little of both. We definitely have continued. At the beginning of the year, we started a round of produce investments which we've continued through the year and we've added some additional ones in some categories. But it's been more of a constant work primarily in produce, a little bit in grocery, a little bit in meat and seafood where we've worked on prices, we've tried to really get ourselves very clear on pricing to the marketplace. We've watched what's going on in the marketplace, adjusted for some of that and it's kind of an ongoing process where we're happy with \u2013 we're especially happy with the unit growth that we've seen in produce and in some of the other areas. And that's encouraged us to look forward to doing even more next year.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yes, this is David. I also want to say, we really feel like we're hitting our groove with our produce prices here in the Austin market and we're encouraged to roll that out in other places in the next year.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much and if I could, just one quick, quick question, can you just give us an update going back to the trust and loyalty?", "263": " We have slowed down the rollout which we originally anticipated because we've gotten so much feedback from our customers about the features they like or the suggestions they have. So we're on to a couple new markets and that's where we are right now. We're just going a little slower in order to get it right as we go, but we are \u2013 so that's where we are.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thank you.Operator: And our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thanks. In terms of that 365 store in Silver Lake, at least according to some media reports, that location originally was going to be a legacy banner with a wine bar, et cetera. I'm curious, can you talk about some of the factors that went into your choosing this particular location for the 365 launch? What about that area was most appealing that led you to go with that one rather than somewhere else?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's a super cool neighborhood; probably all want to live there. So we're pretty excited about \u2013 we're excited about it, we feel it's a very knowledgeable core customer that understands Whole Foods. We also think that there's a variety of other stores right inside that market that we can compete with very well. And it's also, with our 365 brand, we see that size store, that's in Silver Lake, actually fits within that brand, the 365 model and Whole Foods is the mother ship that will be bigger stores, more like 40,000 to 50,000 square feet and that kind of fit the right market and also we really were excited about the work that Ken and I and Jeff and the team have done in terms of the very interesting store designs, some of the tech enhancements, and we want to get it out in the public sooner than later because so we've signed that \u2013 we had that signed lease, so we just kind of intercepted it for the 365 concept and we're thinking that we're probably going to be able to still sneak a wine bar in there.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.", "264": " It's going to be where we can do all the really cool stuff with our prepared foods, lots of venues, bigger product selection; it's just these are going to be \u2013 I mean, more stores kind of like our flagship store in Austin and we think that type of format has tremendous competitive advantages in the marketplace. We see the \u2013 but to get big store locations, that's a more selected markets that we can do those type of stores. We see the 365 stores as being a smaller and able to slide in, in lots of markets where we can't find a big format store. So, same quality standards, and they'll be just a little bit different focus. It'll be a lot easier to explain actually when we open a store up and people can see it, then it'll be really clear, it's like oh, I get it. And hopefully you'll say this is a terrific idea.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, Ken, I think the intent here, just to remind you on the 365 is just to expand the reach to more customers to more communities and while we're starting in one that we're well-established in, it's an area that we're not exactly in right now. And I think \u2013 so it does complement the other stores that are around it, but it just \u2013 that's the whole purpose of 365, is to see about broadening our reach a little bit.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. That's very helpful, I appreciate it.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you for the question.Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the perishables deflation. It's obviously something that a lot of players are struggling with right now. Is it something that affects Whole Foods differently or harder than maybe some of the conventional grocers? And also how do you foresee it playing out? When do you think you could anniversary the pressure on the perishables deflation side? And just my second sort of little question.", "265": " Thanks again.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Hi, it's A.C., I'll answer the first part. We've definitely been seeing some deflation in produce and a lot of it is our pricing investments. Because we're not seeing deflation, for instance, in organic produce, there's a lot of demand there. And there's still upward pressure on prices. And we sell a lot \u2013 such a high percentage of organic produce that affects us. But our pricing initiatives in produce have definitely caused us, overall, to see lowering of prices. As I said earlier, we've been very happy with the unit lift there. The other area we've seen a little bit of deflation is in seafood. Some of the higher volume items that we sell like wild salmon at this time of year is cheaper than last year. Shrimp prices have come down and we also are selling more of our value frozen program. I know that I've seen some other retailers talk about a deflation in dairy, and while conventional dairy has come down a little bit, organic dairy which we sell a lot of, is still seeing inflationary pressures. So, in cases like that, we're probably dealing more with an issue of trying not to pass along some of the price increases that we've been seeing to keep those prices reasonable. We're also seeing a little bit of inflation in a few key areas like nuts like almonds and pistachios have definitely been seeing a lot of inflation because of the droughts in California. And we saw a lot of olive oil, and there was a big crop failure in Italy this year, so we're seeing a little there. So, we're really seeing a little bit going both ways in inflation.Glenda Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Now with regard to cannibalization, just a little bit on that. We do estimate that in Q3, the impact was about 30 basis points greater than it was in Q2 and that'll probably continue, if not get a little bit worse in Q4.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah, this is David, just adding a little color to what Glenda said. We just opened our six of seven Dominick's locations we acquired last year, Green Bay Road. And we're going to open our seventh, Willowbrook, a little bit later in the year.", "266": " That's really helpful. Thanks very much.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.Operator: We'll take the next question from Mark Miller with William Blair.Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you explain what's happening with the square footage development next year that's creating that back weighted dynamic? And then, is the organization giving consideration to moderating the expansion pace? And then I know there's a belief in the long-term, but given the fluidity of comps, it would seem like you would need to have visibility on what that comp rate can be to know what you can pay for real estate. So, why not slow down the growth?Glenda Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, just with regard to the square footage growth, this is Glenda, that's just timing of store openings that creates the difference between the ending square footage growth and the average square footage growth next year. So, we have quite a few openings towards the end of the year.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And with respect to your second question, I'll say it. John, you want to add some too a bit? I would tell you, this team is 100% focused on looking at every aspect of our business, including growth rates and what possibilities might be there with some of the leases signed on their way. There's some limited flexibility in the first bit of time, but all those scenarios are being looked at as to what makes the most sense for the company. So, do you want to add to that, John?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, of course, I hope this isn't heresy, but we actually don't manage the company to maximize same-store sales, but to maximize return on invested capital and EVA. And what the slowdown in comps does in real estate is that it requires us to reformulate or recalculate when we look at new stores with a lower comp base that means it's a tougher real estate hurdle. So we just had a real estate meeting on Tuesday and all the sites that we were looking at on Tuesday, which was about 10 sites, they all had to have a lower comp expectations.", "267": " So we've already adjusted, you might say, to a lower comp basis. And that makes it more difficult for locations to hit the ROICs and EVAs that we require. I suppose the good news is that even with the lower comps, we still found a lot of sites that are going to be extremely profitable for us and profitable for the shareholders. So I think the key takeaway there is that we're not going to slow down our growth unless we can't find locations that are going to produce five-year EVAs on a present value basis and give us the returns on invested capital that we're looking for. As long as we can, that's how we're going to continue to manage the business. And so, anyway that's our answer.Jim Sud - Executive Vice President, Growth & Business Development: I'd make one more point, with the 365 stores, you have this ability to look at real estate differently and the low cost to build-out gives you that opportunity for growth there that we could look at sites that are Whole Foods, and we could also look at sites that are for 365. So that opens a whole new dimension for us with real estate as well.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, said another way, Scott (sic) [Mark] (34:46), we did go back and look at everything and again look at all the metrics for the ones that have been improved or in improvement. And to John's point, just apply the higher standards to make sure the growth that we're doing, we're on track with from an investment and capital allocation standpoint and so that's where we are. We feel good about what we're doing and that's why we reaffirmed our growth goal.Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just a clarification, after the financial crisis, you were able to go back and adjust some of the terms and conditions. Was that a function of that era or as necessary, could you do that here with 114 in the pipeline if as circumstances develop you need to? Thanks.Jim Sud - Executive Vice President, Growth & Business Development: This is Jim. I think 2008 was more a function of the economic reality of the time, particularly as it related to developers.", "268": " And so, it gave us an opportunity to exit some sites that became marginal based on the economic times.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, they couldn't get their financing, so we terminated. We're not in the same situation today. We have gone back and reviewed all our real estate and, yes, there are a few locations that given the current comp environment are not five-year EVA deals anymore, but they're still good deals for us. And so the most important thing is for the ones that are in the pipeline, in a sense, we're legally committed to go forward. And we're still very confident that most of those stores are really outstanding stores. All we can do is adjust to the new comp environment by changing our real estate protocols to have a steeper approval hurdle to get through and we've done that. We've made the adjustment. And so the stores that we, for example, signed and announced today, those are all going to do well with very low comps according to our projections.Jim Sud - Executive Vice President, Growth & Business Development: And if you look at the development schedule as a whole, the 114 stores, prior to the adjustment in comps, they average less than five years EVA on a pro forma basis. So it's not as though we've gone from five years to six years to seven years, we feel like the overall schedule is still within the five-year EVA.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Maybe one other thing to add, we've also made the real estate hurdle even tougher because we have assumed our \u2013 we've looked ahead and we've assumed the price investment for making, we've dialed that into the formula. So we're assuming for new stores, much lower gross margins than they've historically had. And even so, we still are finding great sites at lower gross margins with lower comp growth that still hit our five-year EVA hurdle.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. Also the stores that we opened this year, we opened a lot of blockbusters and we are very excited. Stores like Miami, Streeterville, Ink Block in Boston, Dublin, Northern California, Upper East Side, Avalon in Atlanta, Playa Vista, these are all blockbuster, high volume locations.", "269": " Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: And also there's some concern there about the cannibalization that these new stores have, but keep in mind that we always factor in cannibalization to all of our EVA approvals for new sites. So that's in the factor of us approving it within a five-year EVA.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: So wrapping it all up with a bow Scott (sic) [Mark] (38:32) I guess what you want to know is that we really have gone back and looked diligently at that, at the different scenarios, done the work, reset the standards and so there's our numbers for 2016 at the 38 stores to 40 stores. So thanks for the question.Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, it's Mark, Walter, but...Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, I'm sorry.Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for all the color.Operator: Okay. And we can take our next question from Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets.Bill Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. So I was just wondering what were comparable store sales in the period if you excluded the impact of store refreshes?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We didn't make that calculation. So I don't know if we could answer off the top of our head.Bill Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I guess, so slightly different direction, back on 365, I'm a little confused. Is the primary goal to capture new incremental customers who don't currently shop Whole Foods? Or is it to capture additional trips from existing customers?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's both. It's both.Bill Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: (39:40) strategy.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Although not to quibble with words, we never feel like we can capture any customers. At best, we can rent them for a little while if we continue to create value and service to them.", "270": " But I think it's going to open up a whole new set of customers who, so far, have for various reasons, have not liked Whole Foods Market. Potentially, potentially, they think our prices are too high. There's no question 365 is going to have very, very competitive prices.Bill Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then real quick on the House passing H.R.1599, do you guys have any comments there on what the next steps are toward GMO labeling?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, we know that the House passed it and we know that the proposal is that there would be USDA would set up programs and that no mandatory labeling would be required. And if any laws were passed by states, they would be preempted. We know that it still has to go to the Senate and it could still -a lot could change from what it is currently. It may happen, it may not happen, we don't really know any of that. We've made very clear that we support labeling. We think it's important from a transparency standpoint. We've heard from a lot of our customers. And we have polls that have shown that the vast majority of Americans would like to know if there's GMOs in the products. So we support labeling because for people to know that. How it will affect us, we don't know, we're not exact 100% sure, but we don't think that it affects any of the current labeling that we have in place that we've worked with the non-GMO project and are working with some other third-party verifiers. We think that from the way we read the law that they would be able to get \u2013 the programs they're working with wouldn't be disrupted by this and eventually they could get accredited to continue to do what they're doing.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. My interpretation, John here, is that it doesn't affect Whole Foods at all. Whole Foods is still committed to transparency regarding GMOs. We're going to continue with doing exactly what we committed to do, and we will hit our deadlines. My interpretation of reading that is they're basically trying to preempt states like Vermont and other states from creating their own GMO laws.", "271": " It will not affect a private certification or Whole Foods' own efforts for transparency.Bill Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our last question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thank you. Wanted to dig in a little more on your produce price cut test markets. Our price arrays were showing that you were doing about a 10% to 12% price cut in those produce areas. And initially, it sounded like you were getting a double-digit volume lift there. You now had some duration to it. Are you still seeing enthusiasm from customers now that the test has been going on for some time? And have you been taking some of those best ideas out to the other stores in the produce sections?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, we've often said \u2013 we've found in the past that when you make price adjustments and price investments in the produce department, there's lag time. It can take anywhere from six months to nine months until you start to see \u2013 initially you'll see a nice increase in units, but you still maybe negative in overall sales dollars because, depending on how deep your price cuts are. So we've been encouraged and started to see in the last couple of periods where the actual sales have gone positive, and those produce departments are comping positive now so that the units now have increased in a lot of them above where the investment is. That's been very encouraging to us. And we definitely have plans to use those learnings in additional stores and regions as we go forward, especially next fiscal year.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: And you had mentioned you were going to move beyond five markets. So how many are you in now with the produce price cuts?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: They're currently \u2013 the produce investments we did were in five regions. And each region has several markets that they're in.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for listening in today.

For a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the GAAP figures, please see the tables in our earnings release.", "274": " I will now turn the call over to Walter Robb.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Cindy. Good afternoon, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion (sic) [$3.7 billion] (1:45). We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin, and 13% adjusted return on invested capital. In keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $239 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in available capital. We opened 12 new stores, including our first 365 by Whole Foods Market. As we discussed last quarter, we expanded our produce price investments and launched weekly deep discount promotions in several categories. We supported our efforts with an enhanced ad campaign, which in addition to produce, featured weekly meat, seafood and prepared foods offers and highlighted our quality differences. We produced a 45 basis point improvement in comps from last quarter, as a significant improvement in items per basket more than offset decreases in transactions and average price per item. The combination of our value strategy, disinflation in some categories, and customers trading down to lower-priced items resulted in a year-over-year decline in average price per item. While our value strategy is continuing to negatively impact comps and gross margin, we are seeing a broad-based lift in items per basket and are encouraged with improving traffic trends in certain key departments, particularly produce. Our ongoing expense discipline was reflected in the 82 basis point improvement in salaries; however, these savings were more than offset by higher healthcare, depreciation, marketing, and technology investments as a percentage of sales. Our marketing and technology investments were on budget, but greater-than-expected healthcare costs and lower-than-forecast sales resulted in SG&A deleverage. Our catastrophic claims and costs for certain new prescription medicines were above forecast and, while we are working to reverse these trends, these higher costs are expected to continue in the short-term. As you recall, back in February, we added digital coupons to our app, introducing the first component of our national affinity program. Coupons quickly became the most-used feature within our app, and customers can look forward to a continued expansion of offers.", "275": " Local customers can register at wholefoodsmarket.com to save instantly on member-only deals like 10% off their first purchase, earn rewards for free products, and receive surprises just for shopping at our stores. With each scan at the checkout, easy-to-use, customers increase their savings and personalize their future rewards. This new program builds upon our initial pilot in Philadelphia, while adding improvements that allow us to be more strategic in the ways in which customers can earn and redeem their rewards. Once the test is complete, we look forward to national rollout of the program sometime next year. Just two weeks ago, we opened our second 365 store. We want to really appreciate Jeff Turnas, Isabelle Francois and their team for all the hard work and enthusiasm that went into pulling off a highly successful launch of our new value brand. Designed around affordability and convenience and supported by enhanced digital experiences, 365 delivers a fresh new format to the marketplace, and the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Through lower capital and operating costs, we were able to offer great values, which we believe are attracting a broader customer base than we typically see at Whole Foods Market stores. While 365 offers a curated mix at sharp price points, we are seeing larger basket sizes with more items versus our metro averages. This is a pleasant surprise that has led us to a re-design of the front end already. Our 365 stores are firsts for us in so many ways, from a streamlined operating model, to centralized buying, to auto-replenishment of inventory. With 20 stores in development, we're very excited about the learning potential, and we are already using these to shape and evolve not just future 365 stores, but Whole Foods Market stores as well. This week, we also welcomed two new flagship Whole Foods Market stores in Brooklyn, New York and Santa Clara, California. Averaging 50,000 square feet, both stores are designed to take advantage of the dense, urban locations with extended prepared foods experiences. Our Williamsburg store in Brooklyn has taken our prepared foods venues to the next level with a food hall featuring some of New York City's best, most beloved and up-and-coming favorites like Luke's Lobster Tail Cart, No. 7 Veggie, and East Coast Poke. We worked very closely with each partner to customize their menu and provide our customers with a unique dining experience they simply can't get anywhere else.", "276": " This store also features our partnership with Imperfect Produce as a part of the ongoing commitment to reduce food waste. Turning now to the Q4 outlook, we have opened three stores and expect to open two more. While we are hopeful the sequential improvement in the comps continues, especially in light of an easier 110 basis point comparison over the next nine weeks, we have yet to see stability in our two-year comp trends. In addition, we expect some ongoing headwinds from our value strategy and disinflation. If comps are in line with the negative 2.4% we have reported quarter to-date and healthcare cost continue \u2013 the trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 2% and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.24 for the quarter. As we stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we've had about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure through enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring, and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of Fiscal 2017. While we have some headwinds to overcome in the form of the lower sales and the higher healthcare costs, that larger goal remains intact. As we look towards 2017, we expect ending square footage growth of approximately 6%, down from 7% this year. Next quarter, we will provide more information on the expected number of Whole Foods and 365 openings along with other fiscal year targets. While we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we plan to grow square footage at a more moderate pace this next year to lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our existing stores and to allow us to focus more time and resources on our key initiatives. We are reviewing our entire development pipeline and, as appropriate, are making adjustments to capital budgets and operating models to reflect more conservative projections for comps and gross margins, as well as to apply the learnings from 365. In closing, food retailing has continued to evolve at an incredibly fast pace, and consumers have more options than ever before. And in the face of this challenging environment, we are starting to see some encouraging signs in terms of our sales. We are making measurable progress in fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers before, during and after their store visit.", "277": " We will now take some questions. The call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. So please limit yourself, if you can, to one question at a time, so that everybody has a chance to participate. Thank you.Operator: Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Cindy McCann - Global Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, we could not hear that.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have a little bit of a...Cindy McCann - Global Vice President-Investor Relations: You are cutting in and out. Could you please say it again?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, are you there? You're not coming through to the room here.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: She's having technical difficulties. Sorry. Did you not hear --Operator: I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: There you go.Cindy McCann - Global Vice President-Investor Relations: Yes, we can hear you.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Now we can hear you now. Yeah, we weren't able to hear your statement though...Operator: I'm so sorry. And our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Hi, guys. Good afternoon.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Maybe just to start with the comps? Could you talk a little bit about cadences and what you saw throughout the quarter? I know you lapped the New York quality issues towards the end, but also there were some negative FDA headlines. And then, as we think about the quarter to-date, was there any noise within the numbers related to calendar? I know some investors have been talking about July 4 as some type of shift, although I'm not really sure how this impacted the results. So, any color there would be helpful.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Great. Good questions. Thank you.", "278": " I think there is some noise around the July 4, just because there are some anecdotal thoughts about how folks are spending their time this summer. Whether it's happening a little earlier or later, it's hard to read through those numbers, but I think really the takeaways. Yes, we saw just a little bit of incremental improvement moving through these past three weeks. And Glenda, do you want to add to that?Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, Walter, that's pretty much it. The comps for the quarter as a whole were pretty stable from start to finish. We did see a little improvement as you said in the last 10 days. And then no significant changes into the \u2013 what we've seen in Q4 so far.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then just a quick follow-up here, as we think about 365. I mean, obviously the stores have gotten a lot of positive press, but if you take a step back and highlight some of the things that you've learned so far from the concept? What can be applied to the core, could you maybe elaborate that on a bit?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I love that question. And we'd be happy to do that. And Ken and David are going to roll with it.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. Probably the first thing I would say is customers have really accepted kind of this new design. It's a fresh look. It's a fresh feel. They're kind of accepting it as a brand new brand. And just lots of kind of \u2013 even though it's a value brand, it's still a really fun place to shop. And I think in addition to that, we're finding that customers are readily accepting items that are full service at Whole Foods in the self-service environment at much lower prices in the 365. So, we're seeing our meat and seafood percentage of sales being very similar to what they are at Whole Foods even though they're 100% self-service. Ken?Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: And also, one of the big things is the way we set up the team structure there, we've learned a lot from that in terms of creating the leadership and the way the team members operate.", "279": " It's significantly informing us on how we want to evolve Whole Foods. Also the way in which they're ordering. We're using the technology to help us order, actually, almost to the point where they're \u2013 the technology is ordering for the store, which is a huge advancement for us. Jason, do you want to add anything?Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: Yeah, I mean, the other aspects, we've got a lot of engaging technology for our customers. The digital experience. We've been able to test out a number of concepts, one of them that particularly of interest is a partnership we have with the company called Sage, which gives nutritional transparency for items that we're selling in the store, and we're looking forward to take many of these digital experiences that we've been working on and bring them back to Whole Foods as well.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: And with just the two stores, every 365 will open with our new loyalty card program, Gimme 10, which is 10% off key items at the 365 stores. And in just six weeks, we've had over 16,000 sign-ups.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think having the \u2013 this is Walter again \u2013 having the deadline of having that store open really allow us to push to get that rewards program up and going, and then we are able to pivot all those learnings into the broader affinity program that we're launching today in Dallas. So, I just think that what I've seen is the learnings that have come from this store have really \u2013 are rapidly moving through the rest of the company. And this team here has gone through the entire development pipeline as we mentioned in the script, and looked for opportunities to learn and apply in every single situation in a very vigorous manner. So, a lot of excitement about what we've learned through launching this format. Thanks for this question.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. One question, two fast parts on 365.", "280": " And the second part is, I know granted it's still early, only a couple months after the first store opening. But anything that you can see even qualitatively in terms of your closest core stores in that area if trends in either direction have changed?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll answer the second part and then David and Ken or others can pick up the first part. But essentially, we are tracking really closely the impact \u2013 we're doing several experiments in the two different markets to sort of understand that. And we've got a pretty good handle on that. But it's too early for us to share data on what that looks like. I will say broadly that at least my view is that we're creating a new customer here. We're attracting a new customer. We are broadening the import and the effective Whole Foods Market in the marketplace through these stores. We're reaching customers that we historically have not reached. That's clearly what the data shows. And so David and Ken, over to you. Do you want to answer the first question?David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah, I mean \u2013 we're seeing the first three stores as tests and experiments. So, we're kind of adjusting all the time, but the big one was that we were busier than we thought. So, sort of like we had capacity issues with getting customers through our register systems. And also the big factor is that the baskets are much bigger. So, the kind of smaller, teller-style registers that we were using were not effective for the size of the baskets we were getting. So, we've adjusted the design for Lake Oswego. We're going back and adjusting for Silver Lake and then all the future designs. So, the great thing is with these first three stores, we are testing out a few product variations, a few layout variances, and with the idea being by the time we get to store four in Ohio, that we'll be kind of completely dialed in.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: And one of the bigger evolutions too is our Friends of component in the Portland stores included into the overall design versus it being a separate sort of experience.", "281": " And we see that whole approach of using the Friends of concept into Whole Foods. We really think that that's going to be a huge differentiator for us as we grow and evolve that into our Whole Foods model.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah. Friends of 365 and Whole Foods is a great way to introduce young entrepreneurs like CHLOE with Next Level Burger. Sorry, Next Level Burger and CHLOE. And also has the big side \u2013 potential benefit or actual benefit of reducing our labor costs in our existing stores.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, do you want to add something?John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: Yeah, thanks Walter. I think we'll have a lot more to say about 365 when we get into our Q4 call in November. We're very happy with the initial start of the first couple of stores. We're very happy with the way it came out. We think we've created a very successful new business model, which we're going to expand rapidly. And we'll have more information about that next quarter. One thing relevant is we're opening our third 365 store in Seattle area, in Belleview in September. And that's a very interesting opening for us, because we don't think the cannibalization from 365 to Whole Foods Market is particularly great. Because as Walter indicated, we think we're getting a new customer in there. Belleview will be a good test, because we're going up against one of our flagship stores there. And where, in both, our Lake Oswego in Portland and our Silver Lake store in L.A. area, the Whole Foods Market stores are not particularly close to it. So, Belleview's very close. So, that's going to be very interesting. We'll have more information when we do our Q4 report of what kind of cannibalization impact this is going to have. So, we're very excited about that. We're very excited about 365 and we look forward to better informing you as time goes on.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.", "282": " We think they'll sometimes use the 365, sometimes they use the Whole Foods Market. And there may be distinct groups, and I think we'll be able to answer these questions in a relatively short period of time very, very clearly. But net-net, it looks like a) we've created a broader market for our company for our products, our standards, our experiences. That's what the information suggests. But as John mentioned, we'll be back with a lot more specifics around that in its future in November when we're back for the Q. So, thanks for the question.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful color. Thanks guys. Good luck.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Vinnie.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess the first area, I wanted to start with is your expenses. We saw again another strong quarter of expense control. And if my math is right, excluding D&A, I think your expenses are close to flat or up maybe 1% year-to-date even with about 7% square footage growth. And I know you're not giving guidance today, but as we look out to next year, is there any clarity you can help us provide in terms of, of the $300 million in savings, whether more of that hits this year or whether we should see more benefits in 2017?Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Rupesh. This is Glenda. We certainly wanted to reiterate in our remarks today that our $300 million target remains intact, but we have never put a specific timeline on that. We have made measurable progress on it in 2016 with the large restructuring that we did at the beginning of the year. And with other initiatives that are ongoing at Whole Foods Market. So, we feel good about that. Obviously, it would be a lot easier for us to get there if we had higher sales and we didn't have this healthcare hurdle to overcome. But, we do have a lot underway, both in the way we're doing word processes at Whole Foods, with the way technology tools are being enhanced to help us reduce labor.", "283": " All the inventory is automatically ordered. So, that's a big one that's going to happen for us at some point.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just the technology also enhances the customer experience. That's the other beautiful thing. It's a two for one deal. When you make these investments you're going to create something that the customers really enjoy experiencing. So, yeah.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David, I also say we really want to appreciate all of our team members in our regional presence for the real hard work that they're doing on this restructuring. And they realize the competitive nature of what's happening and the need for us to reduce expenses. And they're all collaborating and working really hard to do it. And then all of our regional presidents have gone and seen the 365 stores and are kind of electrified by some of the labor savings and some of the structural changes that we've done there. And they're already starting to go back and figure out ways to put some of those pieces in place at the Whole Foods Market stores.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say we just have so many things we're working on to really create this transformation of the company. And appreciate them for being able to help us work through so many things at the same time making our way forward. So, thank you for the question.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Walter, you mentioned the traffic trends in produce were actually improving a bit. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit? And just give some context around where your price investments have been focused and the kind of response that you've seen.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll just say quickly and then A.C. is going to give you the substance of it. Basically, yeah, that's right. We've seen a positive variance to store traffic there. I think that's directly attributed the results we're doing in produce. A.C., will give you the details.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Hi.", "284": " And we expected when we made these investments that initially we would see a drop in sales as well as margin. But, we've been slowly seeing a nice pick up in average produce items in a basket, and that's helped to offset part of the investment. And we're definitely seeing a positive trend. We did a lot of investment the last six weeks or so with summer fruit, with cherries and blueberries and strawberries and things like that. And so, really nice \u2013 really we move a ton of product. And so, we're seeing a nice trend in that area. In our experience, I mean, produce is an extremely competitive area. And in our experience, it's hard to turnaround a trend in produce, but we feel like we really have. And we're going to continue to invest in that area and continue to see a nice pick-up in items per basket.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. I'd also say we're about six weeks into our national flier. So, first time in our company's history where customers are actually seeing these produce sales across all channels across the whole company at the same time. So, we hope that that's having an effect as well. Thank you.Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And do you have plans to add these \u2013 to make some more investments across other categories? Are you going to roll those out in the next couple of quarters, or how should we think about that?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: What we've said broadly is that we kind of gave you the goal of lowering our gross margins by 200 basis points over two years and we kind of sketched out a sequential decline quarter-to-quarter as we continue to make those, but we're not revealing any further details beyond that in term of we're going to do what it takes to be competitive. So, that's where we'll leave it.Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi. You mentioned some disinflation. Could you talk about the categories where you're seeing it, and did you see any down-step in the produce as the quarter played out?A.C.", "285": " A.C. here. Absolutely. I'd say overall, we were pretty flat to slight deflation in costs this quarter. And where we saw the most deflation in terms of our retail prices were in produce. As we mentioned, that's where our biggest investments have been. In meat, we saw a little bit of deflation as well. A little bit of deflation in beef costs and a little deflation in our actual retail prices mainly due to an expanded promotion strategy that we were doing. Those are the two biggest areas. I'd say we've definitely seen also a little deflation in our bulk products, things like almonds and other prices like that really dropped off the cliff and we've lowered our prices pretty significantly in a couple of major commodities there, too.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: And how about dairy? Anything going on there?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: You know, dairy, it varies a bit in dairy. We know eggs are kind of in excess around the country, so egg prices are flat to deflationary. Milk prices, for us, have been fairly steady. In select markets, we have lowered milk prices in a few areas, in select markets. So, certainly the prices aren't going up.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: In dairy.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: And then for Walter, are you having more competitive openings versus a year ago? Maybe you could talk about that, because I know you've talked a little bit about cannibalization, but what's going on with competitive openings versus your base?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's see, I don't know that we have those numbers, and I don't know that we share them with the group here, but I'm going to say look, the competitive \u2013 the shift in the marketplace around just a tremendous amount of competitors opening all around as people rush into this space continues. I think it might be flat to slightly up in terms of the Q-to-Q thing that if I looked \u2013 if I remembered the numbers correctly. So, I think you're \u2013 let see here. We just saw the numbers.", "286": " Perhaps those are \u2013 I mean, it's just \u2013 it's very, very competitive out there right now. And as A.C. mentions, there's deflation in a number of categories that you work in headwinds. And in addition to that, we're pushing aggressively into our value efforts, so all those things create the sort of combination I think that brings us the results.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: It's David, I can also say it's actually been a lot of fun and really exciting to open our 365 stores against all of our competitors. So, it's definitely a very exciting time.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's also exciting like in Chicago to start cycling over. We opened seven stores last year in that metro and then this year we're coming back around cycling on those and it's wonderful to see those things really start to bloom. But generally, it remains a very, very competitive market out there. I wonder at some point whether some of them will rationalize and close as we saw happen with at least one of the competitors in the last number of months. But that's the world we're in and customers have lots of choices and we're sharing with you kind of our thoughts about how we continue to push Whole Foods Market forward.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Lapping out of cannibalization is certainly helping your year-agos, but you've had some significant drops in your year-ago comparison and the two-year stack is now negative. Do you think that's mostly just the price investments coming through? Or what do you think is the primary factor for the two year stack going down?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, do you want to get that one?John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: Well, it's a number factors. Certainly, the cannibalization remains a factor, but that's possibly slightly lessening as we anniversary some of the Chicago openings. Yeah, competition, I mean it's not a big secret, is it? There's a lot more competitors in the marketplace and there's a lot of new formats in the marketplace, from home meal replacement to meal kits, fast casual restaurant growth. More entrants in the natural and organic food space.", "287": " These are all factors. Whole Foods Market being the leader, having very high sales per square foot. We probably feel the brunt of it, as there's a bit of a regression to the mean as we lose customers from a convenience standpoint. People don't drive as far as they used to drive, because there's good enough alternatives in many cases close by to them. So people may not be driving as frequently as far as they used to, because they can stop by a Kroger or an HEB or a Wegmans to get products that they can use to only be able to get Whole Foods. Now there's some overlap in our product base and other competitors. So, I think there's no sense in denying it. Competition is bigger and we're responding to it as we think an intelligent measured way. And we still remain very bullish about our future prospects.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We did mention in the script again, we got a nice little tailwind of 100 and some odd basis points over the next nine week, which we hope to see if we can take advantage of. But we'll see how it all goes.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: I mean, one thing's probably continues to be underreported is we keep opening a lot of great stores. Just yesterday, we opened up two flagship stores that are just kicking butt. They're just amazing stores. They're awesome stores that are doing huge sales and they're going to be very profitable for us.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, again, that's in Brooklyn and Santa Clara, California, are the two flagships John's mentioning. Thank you for the question.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Thanks.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to follow-up on the July 4 answer you gave. I wasn't quite sure what you said. I know it's very hard to measure. But it almost sounded to me like you were suggesting potentially the calendar shift was a negative for the fourth quarter to-date number.", "288": " The impact on both Q3 and Q4 of the July 4 shift was completely insignificant.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's just not meaningful either way.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Perfect.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: It didn't really help us in Q3 and it's not really going to hurt us in Q4 or help us in Q4. However, it's not that big a deal. We didn't see that much of change. Niff, niff.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. No, that's perfect. And then if I can quickly follow-up. Typically, Whole Foods will provide a pretty specific outlook for the coming quarter. This time there was a little bit of a change. The guidance was more about what will happen if trends don't change. I'm just curious is this a structural change in how the company's going to provide guidance from here? Or there's more maybe a one-off decision just given some of the uncertainty today?Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, it is just for one quarter. So, we simplified the guidance for that reason. But, we have typically, in many cases said if current trends continue this is what we would see in the quarter or in the period ahead, because until trends change, unless there's some specific event or reason for them to be different than the best thing that we have to go on is the current trends.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, we did not reiterate our prior 2016 targets, but we did give specific guidance for the quarter.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, we hoped our two-year stack comps would stabilize, and that's not happened yet.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, until that happens it's just hard for us to give too much confident guidance.", "289": " I think just the responsible thing is just to be conservative and make sure that we've got the boundaries clearly defined with you have the information that we now have about what we see, as Glenda said. So, thank you for that question.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks. On the quarter to-date trends, any change in traffic versus ticket data versus Q3? And are there any plans for incremental price investments in Q4 relative to Q3?Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There were no significant differences in the trends in Q4 so far compared to Q3.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: And with respect to price investments, they will continue, but we're not going to provide any further detail beyond what A.C. said earlier, because just for competitive reasons.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's fine. And I know it's early, but do you have any initial feedback that you can provide on the mobile coupons, as far as downloads, usage, percent usage? Any sort of data you can share?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jason?Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: Yeah, we've actually had a lot of customers use them. We'll be nearing a million total redemptions to-date very shortly. And right now, we're actually seeing a huge increase in our app being downloaded, which is heavily being driven by our digital coupons. As mentioned in the script, it's actually the number one feature that our customers are using. And we've been seeing close to a 50% increase in the app sessions between Q2 and Q3. And we think it's heavily driven because of the digital coupon offerings that we now have within the app.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And if I could sneak in one more question. You mention meal kits is a competitive factor.", "290": " And it's part of what we're looking at with what we call our meal solution spectrum, which we're really excited about because it's going to address all aspects in which we want to bring food to our customers. And we obviously study and see all the trends out there around how that's changing. And we know that we have a long history of leading in the food/culinary side, and we're going to continue that with what we're doing around looking at the option of meal solutions and the ways in which we want to do that. We're not going to announce anything today. But, we will say that we are committed to this category. We think we have a good strategy for it. It will be revealed.Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: I would say there's a lot of people in the Willy Wonka laboratory working on this thing, right, Ken?Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: We've been tasting a lot of food. And we're really excited about some of the stuff we're going to be bringing out.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think too, world-class. For the first time in the history of the company, have a world-class person from the restaurant/hospitality business reporting directly to David and Ken that's crafted this roadmap for this group. I mean, we're going to have a lot to say about this area. And we think we've got some good credentials to do that. I think you've seen the two flagship stores open today like they did in Brooklyn and Santa Clara. Based on what I'm talking to the regional presidents, the food service experience is huge in that in terms of creating community and correction. So we're going to have a lot to say about this area. Thank you.Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Looking forward. Appreciate the time.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Joe Edelstein with Stephens. Please go ahead.Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon.", "291": " Was a gap there.Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc.: Just wanted to clarify something quickly on the produce comments given earlier, and then I had a separate question. But, you did say that the items per basket in the produce category have been picking up, but I just wanted to confirm that you also said that the actual transaction count \u2013 the customer count was also growing there.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: Yeah. That is correct.Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Great. And then the second question, you did detail kind of expectations for a 6% square footage growth next year, the fiscal 2017 year? Is that really just tied into opening the smaller footprint 365 stores, or perhaps you could just split out for us how you're looking at flagship openings versus your expected number of 365 openings. And even within that, if there's any delay in the flagship openings that may have caused a little bit slower footage growth?John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: Yeah, John here. We're going to stick with the 6%. We're going to give you more color next quarter. When we do the Q4 announcement, we'll give you more color, we're going to give you a break-out of Whole Foods and 365. We'll give more detailed information in Q4, but right now we're just staying with the 6%. It's a little bit in flux right now.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: But the message I think we wanted to get to you is just that we are being thoughtful about our growth and looking at it carefully to determine what the right rate of growth is, given the performance and the complement and where we'd like it to be, so...David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. Also, for those stores we're also, again, studying all the capital savings that we're seeing at the 365 stores. And, again, making some adjustments in the capital spend. No details, but we are focusing on ways that are cost savings.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: Well said, David. Thank you for that question. Yeah.Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc.: Okay. That's helpful.", "292": " Thanks.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: Yes. That's good.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. So, there's a lot of new learning and tech initiatives including I believe a partnership with Nielsen. For that one in particular, what will that allow you to do that you previously couldn't?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: A.C., go ahead. A.C. or Jason?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I'll start and then Jason can add on. Well, the partnership with Nielsen is going to give us a tremendous amount of consumer data that we haven't had before. As we move into doing more globally managed category management within our stores, we really need this consumer information in order to properly set up the categories and know where to do our promotions and know how to price the different categories. So, that's a lot of information that we haven't had. Mostly, what we've had is our own information. So, we're looking at ourselves and this allows us to look much more carefully at the whole industry, all our competitors, and what we need to do to be more competitive.Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: Yeah, just to add on, as you've heard us talk about many times, we operate a lot of our regional structure side of things very autonomously. And this is allowing us to also unify our data to help support some of our other large programs, like the N4 program we've talked about, which is helping us revolutionize the supply chain and purchasing side of our business. And so that will play a very important role in data there. It'll also help us collaborate more with our suppliers, so we'll have one source of the truth as far as how we'll be looking at talking with them about sales and collaboration in our planning processes.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, that's a very important point. Our suppliers are very excited that we are now working with Nielsen.", "293": " That's great. That's very useful. The other question I had was on the testing of Imperfect Produce in California. I know it's early, but how have customers received that so far?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's early like today early.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Breaking news, right?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: So Karen Christensen is one of our strongest purchasing persons in North Cal really has been a champion of this. And she has a really strong produce background. So it has piqued the interest of other regions almost immediately. So, we think that there's definitely some legs to it. So, we'll be happy to give you guys more info next quarter.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, given the broader focus on food waste in the world, I think this is one of the really proactive responsive ideas around how to respond to that, so see how it turns out. Yeah. Thank you for that question. Anymore?Operator: We'll take our final question from Phil Terpolilli with Wedbush. Please go ahead.Philip Terpolilli - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick one. I appreciate all the comments earlier around sort of increased convenience for consumers. Some of the meal kit commentary. I don't think you mentioned Instacart earlier. It's something you've talked about in the past. So, if I could just sort of get an update there as to what you're seeing with that part of the business?Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: As you know, we re-upped that thing and extended it and deepened that. And we feel really good about the partnership with Instacart and the results we're seeing. Week-over-week it continues to grow. In fact, I think we've set a new report every week with the sales. David, do you want to add any more color to that, or Jason?Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: Yeah, I mean, as Walter said, we're continuing to see growth in that space.", "294": " So, we're expanding geographically as far as introducing new markets as well as expanding existing markets, and furthering some of the zip codes. Since the last time we talked, we've also experimented with sort of a new model for click and collect as well for customers to be able to order online and be able to pick up their goods. And so that's something we're going to continue to look at into this particular partnership. So thus far, things have been great.John P. Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Director: And just last thing that I would say is that we've really worked in partnership with Instacart on reducing our out-of-stocks. Which, again, is beneficial with both our in-store shoppers and our digital shoppers. So, we're seeing the biggest reductions I would say I've ever seen at Whole Foods in our out-of-stock rate, which again is a winner for sales.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah, and remember you can go to wholefoodsmarket.com now and order directly off our website via White Label experience we've co-created with them.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I was going to say the same thing. I'm glad you said that. You can go to wholefoodsmarket.com and get it done. All right, so it'll take you right there.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well thank you everybody. Thank you for that question. And we are excited to tell you about where we are with Instacart. Thanks a lot everybody for listening in. We look forward to updating you on our progress and some of the details that we all talked about during the call today on our Q4 earnings call, which will be in early November. Thanks, everybody.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments in response to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.", "296": " Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? Thank you.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods. What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece.", "297": " So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're seeing.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store. So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books. But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you reported versus your guide, so something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happened, what would you attribute that to?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried into the quarter.", "298": " So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for AWS. Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, geographic markets, you would call out there?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I would \u2013 yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally, and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the increased selection. A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was stronger than probably I anticipated.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you, Brian.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you accelerated to 59%.", "299": " And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with John Mackey and his team, and they are very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of the early report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction and is an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers?", "300": " I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or \u2013 roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll continue to hire there.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy in particular? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores.", "301": " And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on campus bookstores. So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of \u2013 they probably have 10 years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you, Brian.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter. And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide \u2013 and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive.", "302": " So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products. On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family. We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base. But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers. So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India?", "303": " Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those other ones you mentioned? Thank you.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early, so those plans will develop over time.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Brian. I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets.", "304": " This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that. And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser \u2013 business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.Scott William Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks.", "305": " First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint. And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year. On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes.", "306": " And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them. We're not sure how it'll play out. But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K early next month. So you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or the four week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...?Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.", "307": " Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of, or the thesis that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And the other investments obviously are on the -maybe on the bigger-ish things or like planes and transportation capacity in general. There our philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum. But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so...Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end the quarter.", "308": " Executives: Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc. Brian T.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.", "309": " Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you that the units \u2013 those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday.", "310": " And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly. But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period.", "311": " So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And then any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles. So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year. So a real step down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage.", "312": " And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year. So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed.Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "313": " I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to? Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies to think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year. So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see how revenue comes in. I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. It's based more on shipping units.", "314": " This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company? Thanks guys.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods. We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omni-channel overlap, especially in the grocery business. On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats.", "315": " We opened five in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I guess two questions. Any color on, it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure? And then, the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it \u2013 any color there would be helpful. Thanks.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I think it's comparable to \u2013 last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30%-plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the two. But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue.", "316": " So that is factored \u2013 I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there. And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave out the impact of ASC 606. And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide.", "317": " Thanks.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now \u2013 up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party. It's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath advertising. And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy?", "318": " So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers. If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter. It's getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "319": " Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there?Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those. And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then, how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of our video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other countries. So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well.", "320": " Adding content, we have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here. Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty soon you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take cost out of our own cost structure and where we can pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre-OC price reductions are a normal part of our business for us.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: (30:42) call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter.", "321": " Company Representatives: Brian Olsavsky - Chief Financial Officer  Dave Fildes - Director of Investor Relations Shelly Kay Pfeiffer - Director of Investor Relations Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com, Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q3, 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 24, 2019 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements.", "322": " With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to know if I could go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4. Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or a tailwind perspective, as we think through some of the moving pieces in Q4? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Hi, Eric. Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our One Day shipping. The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that\u2019s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4. On the guidance front, here\u2019s what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years. There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally on the lines of about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re expecting. It\u2019s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that\u2019s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year. So we factor that in, and then there\u2019s also two other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year.", "323": " So if you wrap those together, we expect it\u2019s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4. For the company, it\u2019s not as large an issue. There is about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it\u2019s expected to be about 80 basis point headwind in Q4. So that\u2019s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4. I think we\u2019re well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think One Day should help with holiday shipping. We\u2019ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we\u2019re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you\u2019ve been increasing availability? And then how should we think about that availability now, and when we get into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us understand how that\u2019s playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2. In Q3, we expected that to grow, we put into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. So as we head into Q4, we\u2019ve added what\u2019s just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, there\u2019s a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.", "324": " You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again the ops team has really done yeoman\u2019s work here to create this capacity for us and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily. We\u2019re expecting that it will be again a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so that they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.Youssef Squali: Great, thank you so much. Brian, kind of just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus One Day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other, because obviously going into Q4 you\u2019re only going to have the latter. And then on \u2013 a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the side. Can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx 4Q also driven at least in part by the higher investment to combat that? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say we\u2019re certainly very diligent on trying to catch counterfeit products. We put a lot of effort into that, we put a lot of human effort, we put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well. But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly two-fold: One around the One Day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, it reached a high of 31% last Q4, excuse me Q3. That was a time when we were \u2013 as we mentioned at the time it was very efficient, we had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017.", "325": " So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year and that was 9% last year. So there has been a step up in infrastructure costs to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that\u2019s essentially, probably the other element of operating income year-over-year, that\u2019s shorter than in prior quarters.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the One Day costs, I appreciate the color. I\u2019m curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structurally? It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there. Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long it\u2019s going to take? And then secondly on One Day, I think it\u2019s mostly U.S. to-date, is that right? And then if not, how do you think about sort of timing on pushing more internationally? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also increased our One Day selection internationally. We\u2019re starting to see some benefits from that. But I would say the biggest impact so far, both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S.  You know we\u2019re still learning here on the One Day costs as we go about what the long-term cost structure will be. We know we have temporary costs in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times to hit One Day cut-offs, things like that, adding sort centers.", "326": " So we will keep posted on a, you know quarterly basis as best we can, but right now, really forward guiding is for Q4.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.Heath Terry: Great, thanks. I know most of the focus on One Day has been on speed, but based on the vans we\u2019re all seeing, it would seem that the shift to more of your own last mile infrastructure is maybe the bigger part of this. As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization, does that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using the third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can you give us a sense of where those people are going you know relative to AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they have been prioritized?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you for your questions Heath. On the first question, I think it boils down to whether it will be competitive long term with other options out there. Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we\u2019re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we\u2019re doing. But in the long run we\u2019re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we\u2019ve used in the past. So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well. But on the cost side, yes it\u2019s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity. On the headcount question, yes we increased as you said close to 100,000 people in Q3. I mean we are up 22% year-over-year.", "327": " Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.Stephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, I\u2019m wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS? When this was first launched it pretty much sold itself and now you are employing a greater number of salespeople, and with that I guess the incremental marketing dollars. But on the other hand it seems like the engineering talent hiring should slow down over time. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can weigh in on what\u2019s coming in or what\u2019s coming out. Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah, sure. I would say the margins \u2013 our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones. And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what we\u2019re doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term. And if you look at our disclosure on our 10-Q, it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS, from AWS customers and that\u2019s up 54% year-over-year. So that\u2019s another thing to watch, it\u2019s not only the short-term commitment, but also the long-term commitment that we see. On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry. If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line. The sales and marketing investment, we\u2019re chasing a large opportunity here and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully confident that that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale. And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Lloyd Walmsley: Thanks.", "328": " So can you talk about maybe how much ad inventory you\u2019ve been able to get inside of networks within that and how meaningful is this to the overall kind of advertising strategy. Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, so let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%. So we are very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue to focus on advancing advertising experiences there, helpful for customers, helping them to see new products, we want to empower our businesses to find attracting and engage these customers and it\u2019s increasingly popular with vendor sellers and third-party advertisers. So it\u2019s still early and what we\u2019re focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers, and to do that, we use machine learning and that\u2019s helping us to drive better, better and better relevancy.Dave Fildes: Yeah. And then Lloyd, this is Dave. Just quickly on Fire TV. I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so that includes the new \u2013 and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV Cube. So a number of things have come out recently. We\u2019re really excited to get into customers\u2019 hands, so more to come there. I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands. It\u2019s still early in this space, but we\u2019ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. So, as I said early days, but I think with the engagement of the device community, the fact that we\u2019re really excited with the progress and improvements of these devices, I think yeah, again a lot of opportunity there.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel.", "329": " There has been a meaningful reacceleration in paid unit growth in the past two quarters with the expansion of the One Day guarantees for Prime customers, and I\u2019m just wondering if consumers are responding more in certain categories that you would highlight over others or is the response fairly broad-based across the product categories where One Day has been expanded? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Hi, Scott. Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. So we do attribute it to One Day. We\u2019re seeing broad sales across all categories. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we\u2019ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.Mark Mahaney: Hey, thanks, I want to go back to AWS. When asked about margins, you first referred to \u2013 Brian you first referred to by bringing down prices. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could you talk about what kind of traction you\u2019ve had building out into the enterprise, and I know it\u2019s a broad question, but take a shot at it. And third part of this is, your interest and your success in going in and generating more app \u2013 you know going up the stack and getting more into the application software space, all that AWS related. Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Hi, Mark. So yeah, I would say my comments around pricing were as much mix as absolute price decreases or competitive price pressures. It\u2019s certainly a competitive market that we see and we\u2019ve seen for really a number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing and is very eager to lock up long-term commitments from AWS customers. We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched. So the bigger element of that really is around us creating new products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old ones. So there is a certain bit of mix issue that we are always up against.", "330": " You know it\u2019s going to be hard on revenue growth, it\u2019s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate. So you know there\u2019s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we\u2019re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market.Dave Fildes: Yeah, and Mark, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has been around, we really pride ourselves in getting really top, high caliber people both in the technical side, but also sales people that are plugged in and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having open lines of communication and that\u2019s really allowed us to innovate quickly and really faster than anyone else, and we see that in the terms of the service and feature breadth and depth that we have. So, a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that that flywheel keep spinning, and that we continue to roll out a lot of great services the customers are looking for. So I think that\u2019s largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it\u2019s kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.Colin Sebastian: Thanks. Maybe first is a follow-up on the logistics and delivery side. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network of drivers and partners. And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or on occasion is delivering products for other merchants or suppliers, not specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity and on the logistics side? Thanks.Dave Fildes: Yeah Colin, hey it\u2019s Dave. Thanks for the question.", "331": " Over time I think you know we\u2019ll look and expect to be able to grow our internal volume using AMZL or Amazon Logistics, but also continue to grow our 3P volumes with carriers, transporters around the world. But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Justin Post: Great, thank you all; it\u2019s going to be a couple here. Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think that\u2019s going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon? And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder if you could just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for third-party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them and how do you think about their profitability on Amazon, if you can comment on that at all? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, yeah. On third party I would say we only succeed if the third party sellers succeeds. So we\u2019re heavily invested in them as they are in us. So we are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new products and features and you know we are cognizant of their economics as well and we want a business that works for both of us and we set our fees accordingly. So I think that you know we\u2019ve \u2013 and I\u2019ll also point out that with the One Day, the increase in One Day sellers have participated, and not as much as anyone else, as much as our 1P offering. So, it\u2019s been a great boon for sellers as well as, particularly in our FBA program. On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of you know the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and you know Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we found in the past is that there is generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between November 15 and - November 1 maybe and December 25, and well certainly Black Friday and Cyber Monday are important dates in that holiday period.", "332": " Some have been moving early in the quarter, some of them moving later in the quarter as customers can count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and have higher faith in delivery just before the holidays. So that\u2019s a little bit color, that\u2019s what\u2019s anticipated in our guidance that we\u2019ve given.Dave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter.", "333": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 29, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "334": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by extending a big thank you to all the folks who worked hard to make this year's Prime Day a great success, not only for our more than 150 million Prime members around the world. But also for the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who sell on our Amazon store many of whom are facing their own challenges during this pandemic. These businesses thrived on Prime Day. With third-party sellers recognizing more than $3.5 billion in sales over the two-day global event, that's 60% increase compared to Prime Day last year. I also want to thank and recognize the contributions of more than one million Amazon employees and delivery partners who are continuing to work hard to serve our customers all around the world, who will continue to spend what it takes to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. Now let me share some highlights from the quarter. Our Q3 results largely reflect a continuation of demand trends we saw when we exited the second quarter. The strong demand in sales growth across our major product categories globally including hardlines, consumables, softlines and media. We also continue to see strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. They continue to expand their usage of Prime's digital benefits including Prime video. Internationally, the number of Prime members who stream Prime video grew by more than 80% year-over-year in the third quarter and international customers more than doubled the hours of content they watched on Prime video compared to last year. We're also reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q3, our year-over-year growth rate of online grocery sales continued to accelerate and we continue to offer more convenient options for customers including grocery pick up which is now available from all Whole Foods Market stores. And just as we saw in Q2, Prime member renewal rates improved in Q3 year-over-year.", "335": " Our 3P sellers services revenue continue to grow faster than online stores revenue. With particularly strong growth this quarter in FBA, as we return to similar mix of FBA as a percentage of total 3P units as we've seen prior to COVID. 3P units continue to represent over half of overall unit volume increasing to 54% of the total unit mix in Q3. We're investing heavily to support sellers and are pleased to report that over half a million sellers are seeing record sales in our stores this year. We continue to focus on stepped up employees safety particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations. To help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners as well as the employees and customers shopping at our Whole Foods Market and other stores. This of course has added incremental cost to our P&L. The largest portion of these costs relate to continue productivity headwinds in our facilities including process revisions to allow for social distancing and incremental cost to ramp up new facilities and the large influx of new employees hired to support strong customer demand. This also includes investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning of our facilities. In total, we've incurred more than $7.5 billion in incremental COVID related costs in the first three quarters of 2020 and we expect to incur approximately $4 billion in Q4. Our consolidated revenue and operating income exceeded the top end of our guidance range. As demand remains strong in the quarter the extra volume and operating leverage helped us to achieve higher than expected profitability. And we saw another strong quarter of revenue growth in operating income performance in AWS and advertising. We had good leverage with our fulfillment centers as well as in Amazon logistics, our transportation network despite the higher COVID related cost that I mentioned. Although we had strong growth in our network in Q3 some of our fulfillment network expansion shifted out a few weeks thought it happened in Q4 rather than Q3. Once new buildings open, their short-term headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. More of this headwind will be felt in Q4 rather than in Q3 and this is reflected in our Q4 guidance. We were able to meet the heightened demand in Q3 because we opened up more network capacity particularly in our transportation network. I pointed two important drivers of this. First, we hired a lot more people to support the strong customer demand.", "336": " I will note that these are permanent jobs with industry leading pay including Amazon's $15 minimum wage and great benefits such as health insurance, 401(k) plan and parental leave. Secondly, this has been a big year for capital investments. We've invested nearly $30 billion in CapEx and finance leases through the first nine months of 2020 including over $12 billion in Q3. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our fulfillment and logistics network square footage by approximately 50% this year which includes significant additions to our fulfillment centers as well as our transportation facilities. Majority of these buildings open in late Q3 and into Q4. About half of this square footage growth will be on the transportation side to be opening more sort centers and delivery stations. And finally, in AWS customer usage remained strong. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. While we're busy gearing up for our Annual re:Invent Conference. This year reinvent will be a free three-week virtual conference running from November 30th through December 18th. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon who have delivered on unprecedented demand for several months now as well as a strong Prime Day in October. We're ready to go and looking forward to meeting the needs of our customers this holiday season. With that, let's move onto Q&A.Operator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I've two Brian. The first one you mentioned the fulfillment center saw good leverage in the quarter. Can you just talk to us about some of the qualitative drivers of this improvement you're seeing in fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit in the quarter and sort of year-to-date and how to think about the durability of that overtime? And then secondly, I think throughout the summer Amazon logistics launched the third-party delivery service in the UK. I'm curious just to hear about early learnings from that product and how you think about scaling that to other countries and maybe globally? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Thanks for your question. Yes, the fulfillment center cost is going to be a blend of part of the COVID related cost that I mentioned in and itemized.", "337": " So that demand is very consistent and strong and has created a lot of favorable leverage because again the order pattern being high and consistent as leveraging our fixed cost assets. Things like our delivery routes are more dense at high volumes. So we see even transportation some increased efficiencies. Offsetting that again is productivity elements that we've articulated things like social distancing, extended breaks. Other steps we're taking to keep people safe and distanced in our facilities, in our delivery network.Dave Fildes: And this is Dave, I don't have much to share I think on, what we've got going on with any of [indiscernible] efforts other than I'll just say, we're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support. The companies we work with including small and medium-sized businesses we sell on Amazon and that includes testing and shipping programs that can help any of these businesses gets packages to customers quickly and reliably.Brian Nowak: Great, thank you both.Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian just wanted to go back to the 4Q operating income guide. I appreciate your thoughts there. Just trying a dig a little bit deeper in terms of how you're thinking about it kind of beyond the $4 billion in COVID cost. It still feels like maybe there's some more in there that we're not thinking about perhaps beyond the square footage increases and the incremental headcount. So if you've any comments there? And just curious I know it's early on 2021, but you've obviously done a ton of investment this year and with the 50% square footage increase and you tend to cycle at times in terms of CapEx investment. Just how you think about [adjusting] [ph] that kind of build out as you go forward? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. One last comment, I forgot to mention to Brian on his last question is, the fact that a lot of that heightened demand so far coming to Q2 and Q3 when we tend to have excess capacity before Q4, so that's another source of leverage especially in non-peak orders. As far as guidance is concerned again, I think there's lot of uncertainty certainly in Q4.", "338": " We saw some disruption in 2016, so there's a whole host of issues that generally come to bear in Q4. I think the fact that COVID is dwarfing all of those is causing us a lot of uncertainty on our top line range. We saw continuation in Q3 of some really good trends from Q2 and we've project those into Q4. Some of the negative factors that you mentioned as foreign profitability is again. We'll see more of the brunt of the capital investment and the people investment. We had a lot of people in the last quarter and then we added another 100,000 people in October so far. So there's that, there's generally the dynamics of Prime Day because it's a deal-oriented time period that's usually not the highest margin period and that shifted into Q4. But generally, we have really because of the calendar this year we have really built our capacity included both in facilities and people and are carrying it through the entire quarter. We carried it through Prime Day and now we're carrying it through into the rest of the quarter. I think in other quarters you might have seen more gradual build up that would have occurred through October end and probably maximized in November and December. So that's what I would tell you on holiday again. We have our normal caveats, so there's a lot of uncertainty and things that could go right and wrong, so that's why we put a range around it. And I'm sorry, could you repeat your second question?Doug Anmuth: Just on how you think about 2021 perhaps just CapEx build out going forward given that you've really stepped up the investment in 2020?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I think some of the investment things like grocery delivery and that capacity are things that we would have invested in over time and it being matched by higher order volume. So our intent is to continue to deliver a great grocery delivery experience for our customers. So that is a little bit of pull forward. Yes, we did expect to build out our logistics capacity a lot this year especially as we have been rolling out one-day delivery the middle of last year, that was setting us up for a big build this year. So we pull forward a bit from 2021 into this year to satisfy the demand. I think we've - the logistics team is really good at in one way you're locking up long-term commitments on space and buildings.", "339": " I think at this point we're not trying to cut it close and we're erring on the side of having too much capacity and we think that's the right call. It has been this year. We'll adjust as we get through the holiday and we'll learn a lot more. Hopefully the pandemic will be in better shape as a country and globe in Q1 of next year. It's very reactionary at this point. We've got to play the hand that we're dealt and we're trying to anticipate and keep the customer insulated from any variability. But it's challenging certainly.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for the color Brian.Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post: Great, thanks. When you look at 3Q the environment, can you help us kind of understand the best you can quantify. How much of the incremental unit sales do you think are being aided by COVID or how much is it just a natural recurring shift online that could recur and continue to grow next year? Any thoughts on that? And then same type of question for the cloud? I'm guessing there's some headwinds of lower transaction volumes for some of your customers and then maybe there's more demand from the work at home environment. So if you could give us any thoughts on both the retail and cloud and how COVID is impacting it and could there be - how that will impact next year? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. It's hard to predict. I would say that there's been phases of this year. Early on there were a lot of stock ups of groceries and other household supplies followed by a wave of people buying gloves and disinfectant wipes and masks. That maybe a bit of bubble that people are not going to buy as much next year hopefully that will be a good problem to have it, as that demand went down. But otherwise we're seeing Prime number engagements. So it's strengthening our Prime program. The renewal rates are going up and the engagement is going up. So people are buying more frequently and across more categories. They're using more of our digital benefit. We like the trends on kind of connectedness to our Prime program and we think that will have lasting value.", "340": " So we think the trends are good. They've been pulled forward probably a bit from our - the adoption curves have been pulled forward from our initial - pre-COVID thinking especially on things like grocery delivery. So your second question on the cloud. Cloud is a mixed bag right now because we're very happy with the cloud performance and we're seeing a lot of customers who are now moving to the cloud at a faster pace. It accelerated their plans. There's anomalies in different industries going on this year things like travel and hospitality are down. A lot of companies are in holding pattern in middle and some are doing really well things like video conferencing, and gaming, and remote learning, and things tied to entertainment. So I would say that majority of the companies though are looking for ways to cut down on expenses. Going to cloud is a good way to cut down on expenses long-term. To trying to cut down on their short-term costs in the cloud, by tuning their workloads and we're helping them do that and doing the best we can to help them save short-term dollars and again tune their usage again some of our benchmark. We think that is good for the customer and therefore, it will be good for us long-term. But even and despite those actions with strong growth the year-over-year growth in absolute dollars this quarter were the largest we've ever seen and we feel good about the state of the business and the state of our sales force and their ability to drive value during this period. We've seen a lot of companies extending their contracts with us. The backlog of multi-year deals has gone up quite a bit. It's good from a customer connectedness standpoint. Certainly each industry is going through different dynamics right now.Dave Fildes: And you can see, this is Dave. I'll just add to that. You can see number of those significant commitments of customers called in [indiscernible] carriers, global payments and number of others. Also seeing some good engagement with governments on their recognizing need to transform tech, get their technology more nimble and innovative. Schools and universities are planning for online learning. So a lot of help we can work with customers to provide there. On the kind of from a product perspective, we're seeing significant momentum with our AWS design Graviton2 processors.", "341": " But they're realizing up to 40% better price performance from the newer Amazon EC2s, the MRC T [ph] instance families. So when you compare that to x86-based instances. Those Amazon EC2 instance families are all powered by our - with our new AWS design Graviton2 processors. So really pleased with what we're seeing there in that engagement as well.Operator: Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry: Great, thanks. Just a couple of things, how should we think about where capacity utilization of the fulfillment infrastructure is at this point with the way the growth that we've seen and the wave of new warehouse announcement? What kind of CapEx is going to be necessary to sort of bring you back to what you would consider normal levels that you'd be growing from? And then there's obviously been a lot of discussion around the capacity limitation the third-party shipping networks are going to see this holiday season given demand. How much of an issue do you see that as being and given your investments and your own delivery capacity does that become a competitive advantage for you during the holiday?Brian Olsavsky: Yes, thanks Health. I'll start with that last one yes. [Indiscernible] intertwined here so. The third-party shipping, we rely on third-party shippers. We've great partnerships around the globe with third-party shippers and we know that their capacity will be tight as well as ours. We do feel good that we've invested quite a bit in our own capacity and you just mentioned that, about half of our CapEx is going to expanding transportation. A lot of the people that we're hiring are also focused on transportation. So we feel good that we've been able to develop that capability a lot of this year because we needed it and we're going to need it in Q4. Having said that, it's going to be tight for everyone and I think it will all be stretched and it's advantageous to the customer and probably to the companies for people to order early this year. But regardless of the order pattern we're going to do our best to get the usual excellent service to our customers. On CapEx levels, again we've grown our fulfillment and logistics infrastructure 50% this year. We'll see again what that implies for next year.", "342": " So that will be start of probably multi-year period where we're hiring CapEx for that. But we'll see, right now we're just focused on Q4 and giving the guidance for Q4. Your question on capacity utilization. It's been very tight this year certainly we're able to fill up a lot of our any excess capacity in Q2 and Q3 that might have seasonally been excess. As we get into Q4 and everything stepping up. We're adding it and using it simultaneously. We had a really good test for Prime Day and we feel good about that performance in that work and we continue to add on top of that. Lots of excitement around the holiday. But we feel we're in good shape and ready to go.Operator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney: Thanks, two questions please. How should we think about these $4 billion expenses in the fourth quarter, $7 billion year-to-date like? Do you view them more as one-time-ish or just overall increases as you built out the network? Are they structural or one-time-ish I really want to get at that? Secondly international segments been nicely profitable or reasonably profitable for two quarters in a row. Is there some reason to think that's sustainable? And I'm sorry, third question. The other revenue growth accelerated to 49% can you give any color behind that? Thanks a lot.Brian Olsavsky: Hi Mark, thank you. Let me start with the COVID question. So we have again, our expenses in Q3 were estimated to be around $2.5 billion and we're seeing closer to $4 billion in Q4. The majority of that is due to the expansion of our operations. So things like productivity that. There's productivity drags for things like new hire ramp, social distancing, extending break periods, things that we can quantify, said look this is a change in our process that has hurt productivity. We also have cost related to - so those are calculated that. There's more direct cost around cleaning and supplies, testing and those are the main things I would say.", "343": " Okay. We know that simultaneously there's some benefits going on right now. There's things like in Q2 we had lower marketing expense you see that in our trends. It's starting to come back in Q3 and Q4 to more normalized levels but certainly everyone. There's not a lot of requirement or need to do marketing this year for parts of the year. We saved nearly $1 billion in travel this year because travel's ground to a halt, internal travel, travel on expenses. So there's things like that will resume at a later date and maybe not get to the same levels as the past. But there won't be as artificially low as this year. So we're trying to be transparent as best we can on the cost we're seeing. We're [indiscernible] netting against some of the favorability's from demand and some of the other cost that might be offsetting although they're not offsetting to the extent that they COVID costs are sitting there. And then I'll point the fact that because we're running at such a high level and at consistently high level really in off peak periods. We have been able to run these warehouses very efficiently. You have to split the discussion kind of between the cost penalty on the COVID related issues. But then there's certainly been some favorability from running assets more fallout condition. Okay, so hopefully that gives you some color on it. International segment profitability. I would say and I think we discussed this a bit last quarter. We're seeing an advancement of volume and very strong volume if you will in especially in our countries in Europe and Japan. So we maybe putting in a way future volume onto this year's cost structure. So that is probably why you're starting to see that is why you're seeing profitability in international. I would say generally we're still investing ahead of the US in a lot of dimensions internationally things like Prime benefits, things like the devices, things like international expansions. You might have seen that we just launched in Sweden yesterday. There's a lot of competing factors going on right now internationally. But I think right because of the high volumes and the leverage we're seeing and particularly in places like the UK and Germany it creating profitability ahead of schedule if you will.", "344": " The third comment was on other revenue. Yes that is essentially getting mostly advertising and we had very strong advertising performance in Q3. So continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. We start to see advertising budgets increase from some of the contraction that had occurred earlier in Q2 and we just had a lot more traffic and we do a good job of turning that traffic into valuable real estate for our advertisers and for our customers to find out more about selection and brand discovery. So most of that is with strong quarter in advertising and that's what you're seeing in the other revenue line.Operator: Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One following up on Mark's question on the advertising side. You know we continue to see you guys innovate a lot on the product side especially with programmatic advertising, video advertising. Can you just give us a little bit of sense of how you see the advertising offering both on Amazon and off Amazon sort of evolving in the years ahead? And the second question would be coming back Brian to your comment in the opening remarks around Prime video and all the consumptions you've seen globally in the recent past. How does that help inform what do you think about in terms of the opportunity when invest against original content to continue to drive that sort of medium consumption loop within the Prime membership. Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, great. Eric I'll start off with the questions on advertising. So just to ground you and I think our main priorities here at the space and some of these probably aren't too surprising is, we're focused on making our tools easier to use. Sponsored ads, sponsored brand site, a bidding sponsored product targeting. Working on just simplifying registration for agencies and marketers, getting set up. But we're also very focused on being smarter about servicing more relevant ads to customers. Making display ads easier and then increasing usability to Amazon demand site platform. So we've been working on a number of those areas and then developing new products and a lot of that's focused around, how are we serving brands from various areas Twitch [ph] sponsored brands, stores of course, so another interesting area.", "345": " Video, you mentioned I think video is one that's we're working hard on with some of the OTT video advertising opportunities there. We're seeing some good momentum with that. We offer inventory and IMDB TV, ad supported space and 3P apps [indiscernible] pulling off the Fire TV. I think good momentum and a lot of good learning on some of those initiatives there. I won't say too much about what we'll look like next year in the future but that gives you kind of sense of priorities where we're spending our time and focused on.Dave Fildes: And your question on video, so we step back in our goals to deliver high quality and fresh content to our global Prime member base. We're doing that by producing top tier US content that we show globally and then we augment that with local originals in each region. If we do that job well - we've seen it as a very significant acquisition channel from new Prime members especially in many smaller countries around the world. We see higher free trial conversion rates. Higher membership renewable rates and then higher overall engagement as I mentioned in Q3 specifically. And when they do that, when the more engaged they are, we know that, that turns into more sales on Amazon and it's a self-reinforcing loop. So we're very happy with the video performance particularly during this period. I think people have gotten really good chance to test out the content maybe Prime members [indiscernible] that benefit as much in the past, have given another look and have you know really found value in it. We're in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide and again we're seeing some really interesting localized content developing in places like India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, UK and Spain which I think the customers in those countries really appreciate.Dave Fildes: Great, thanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months.", "346": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the amazon.com Q3 2021 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 28t, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.", "347": " And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Let me first start by reiterating and expanding on a few comments that Andy made in our earnings release. We are now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began and we're especially proud of our employees for both their response to the unprecedented customer demand we have experienced, as well as for their implementation of many safety procedures to create a safe work environment. During this period, we have continued to earn the trust of our customers, especially our Prime members, who have increased their annual purchases and their use of Prime benefits over the last 20 months. We've also seen strong growth in our advertising products, as vendors and sellers have embraced our ability to build their brands and to reach customers just as they are considering their purchases. And AWS has seen a reacceleration of revenue growth as customers have expanded their commitment to the cloud and selected AWS as their cloud partner. As a result, Amazon 's Q3 revenue of $110.8 billion represented a two-year compounded annual growth rate of 25% versus a pre-pandemic growth rate in the low 20% range. We're grateful to our customers who have put their trust in us. However, there have certainly been challenges to overcome since February of last year. We've nearly doubled our operations capacity in the past two years to keep up with customer demand. We've incurred billions of dollars in additional cost to keep our employees safe and to support testing and other COVID-related costs. And we have grown our global headcount by 628,000 employees in the past 18 months and are recruiting for more, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. to support Q4 seasonal demand. This demand for labor has recently coincided with the shortage of available workers, particularly in the United States. It began in Q2, but it really started to impact our operations and cost structure in Q3. It's led to wage increases and sign-on incentives, as companies compete for workers, as well as inconsistent staffing levels in our operations. In addition, disruption to the global supply chains and inflation in the cost of materials such as steel and services such as trucking have also raised our cost of operations.", "348": " Our Q4 guidance range anticipates that these costs will approach $4 billion in Q4 as we see a full quarter's impact of these effects and a higher seasonal unit volume. Specify in Q3, we saw nearly $1 billion of inflationary pressures, primarily tied to wage increases and incentives in our operations. Our average starting wage is now over $18 per hour, with an additional $3 per hour depending on shifts in many locations and sign-on bonuses that can be up to $3,000. In addition, we saw inflationary pressures in raw materials and services, as I mentioned, particularly in steel and third-party trucking. We also saw over $1 billion of cost tied to loss productivity and disruption in our operations. In Q3, labor became our primary capacity constraint, not storage space or fulfillment capacity. As a result, inventory placement was frequently redirected to fulfillment centers to have the labor to receive the products. This resulted in less optimal placement, which leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes. In short, our operations are normally well-staffed and optimized to be in-stock and to deliver to customers in one to two days. Labor shortages in supply chain disruptions upset this balance and resulted in additional costs to ensure that we continue to maintain our service levels to customers. As you look to Q4, we've incorporated this nearly $4 billion of added costs into our operating income guidance range. In addition, we have a nearly $1 billion year-over-year increase in Q4 for spend to support our digital media content efforts, including video, music, and games. We recently launched New World, a multiplayer online PC game, and we're delighted with the response and engagement. New World has become the highest played new game this year on Steam. Moving to video content. Prime Video has a compelling lineup of live sports, including the UEFA Champions League and Ligue 1 soccer in France, as well as NFL Thursday Night Football in the United States. And we have a great lineup of original series to look forward to, including the Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and Citadel and new seasons from Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Boys. We're excited to add this content to our Prime benefits and increase the value of our Prime membership. Q4's guidance also includes an estimated $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network.", "349": " As we're now back to having more normal Q4 fulfillment capacity and have even brought forward 2022 capacity into 2021, our operating leverage drops compared with last Q4. Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the current trends we are seeing, including the lapping of our Prime Day Event in October of last year. We are dealing with labor risks and supply chain interruptions like many other companies, which increases our range of potential outcomes in Q4. Consumers have started to return to pre-pandemic spending patterns, increasing the mobility and spending more on travel and services in Q2 and Q3. But we're appreciative that the incremental demand that came our way during the pandemic has remained and that we're continuing to grow on top of that. We're all set to make this a great holiday season for customers. Last quarter, we discussed the physical capacity we were adding to meet customer demand. We made strong progress in Q3 to build and open new facilities. And as a result, for the first time since the pandemic began, we're no longer capacity constrained for fiscal space in the network. September alone, we brought online more than 100 new buildings in the United States, including fulfillment centers, source centers, and last-mile delivery stations. For the year, we expect our 2021 footprint additions to exceed last year's buildout, which was also significant. Put this in perspective, we are on track to double our fulfillment network over the two-year period since the pandemic's early days. A lot of this increased capacity supports our FBA sellers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offerings for customers, representing 56% of total paid units sold in Q3, that's up from 54% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, a U.S. conference for selling partners, where we introduce new tools and capabilities, including local selling, which enables sellers to start or expand their multichannel offerings by providing both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers and global selling tools to make it easier for U.S. third-party sellers to offer their products worldwide. I'll finish with a few highlights regarding two fast-growing areas with strong profitability profiles.", "350": " There are number of areas we're excited about, but let's focus for a moment on our efforts in machine learning. Customers of all sizes and across all industries are using AWS as their preferred cloud provider for machine learning services. We've been investing in this area for several years, offering an extensive set of machines learning services, including ones that can be applied to common business problems, like Amazon Connect for contact center intelligence, or Amazon Kendra for intelligent enterprise search. We recently launched solutions specific to industries, including industrial machine learning services, as well as Amazon Health Lake to help healthcare and life sciences customers seamlessly transform their data across disparate sources to understand and extract meaningful medical information. And Amazon SageMaker continues to help customers scale their use of machine learning to core workloads, making it one of the fastest-growing services in AWS history, with tens of thousands of active external customers using it every month. We also continue to see strong interest in rapid adoption of our custom silicon and AWS design Graviton2 processors, delivering customers up to 40% better price performance than current X86 processors. Moving to Graviton2 means little to no code changes, so that customers can quickly and easily migrate their workloads to access the best price performance in Amazon EC2. Last but certainly not least, Amazon Advertising continues to grow quickly, representing the significant majority of other revenue, which grew 49% year-over-year in Q3. We're seeing strong adoption across Amazon vendors, sellers, and authors, as well as brands that don't sell in our store, particularly as we've built out our streaming TV offerings. Of course, advertising only works if we make it useful for customers. And when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. The team also recently hosted unboxed 2021, our annual conference for advertisers and brands, where we shared some of our newest solutions to help companies connect with their customers, measure the impact of their advertising, and grow their businesses. As we shift into Q4, we're heads down, focused on delivering a great experience for our customers this holiday season. We are committed to make the necessary investments in both people and capacity to bring more items in stock and to deliver them quickly to customers. With that, let's move on to Q&A.Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions.", "351": " [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post: Great. Maybe I will ask about fulfillment capacity. You said your capacity is up 2x since before the pandemic and I've got units up around 55% on a two-year basis. So just wondering, is the capacity needed per unit going up as you speed up delivery times and try to get to one day? And then second, are you in really good shape for next year? And could you be ahead of plan for next year and kind of cut down the investment there? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Hi, Justin. On your first question about whether we've \u2013 the comparison of doubling the fulfillment capacity to the unit growth. Keep in mind also that our fulfillment capacity also includes our transportation delivery capacity. And in the last two years, we've also greatly ratcheted up our ability to deliver ourselves through NCL, and our percent of units that we deliver through MCL is over 50% of our units globally. So that's a big -- that's a driver as well. I'd also say that while we've been chasing really demand for last two years, we've been doing it is, as I said, we're running about 100%, pretty much all of last year. We are just now getting caught up on space for inventory and inventory is being brought in to support the holiday. And if you look year-over-year, while units growth is, as you say, closer to 8% in Q3, the cubic -- inventory cube is up closer to 40%, both in North America and internationally. So, there's like the second shoe that's dropping of getting the fulfillment centers back in stock, especially for sellers and especially as we head into holiday. So that's a -- I think that capacity, the amount of space we have for inventory is also going up probably at a higher rate than our unit ship right now. Your question about whether it pulls forward from next year, we're not forecasting into next year.", "352": " But we expect the long- term trends to be strong in this business. We're investing in such -- as I mentioned, the two-year CAGRs, I do that just so you can kind of judge pre-pandemic versus today. We see strong growth even off a base of last year, which was strong. So, we'll see next year on CapEx, and certainly for the foreseeable future, our capacity constraint is actually labor, which is new and not welcome. That's what we've tried to articulate here today. And we are hoping that that rectifies itself through Q4 and into early 2022.Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney: Great. Two questions. First, any color around those international losses in the quarter that was large achievement by Amazon standards, that $900 million? And then secondly, talk about the - you've been spending -- so you've doubled this fulfillment capacity. I think they're really kind of catch up to demand, but now I think like you're getting ahead of it. And as you roll out, you get close to one-day promise that you worked up two or three years ago pre-pandemic, and as you start rolling out, super same-day delivery or what you call sub one-day delivery. Talk about the incremental demand, do you think that that could unlock into the extensive which you're investing against not only to catch up to demand, but trying to liberate future demand if you get my point? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. I definitely do, and I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't include it in my last answer. But yes, we have unfinished business on the one-day promise side. We were ramping that up nicely in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic. We're still not back to levels that we saw pre-pandemic. We're getting closer. We feel again that labor constraints have not helped us close the gap there. But we don't want to be as good as -- just as good as we were before the pandemic. We expect that to increase in 2022, and we're going to plan accordingly.", "353": " I won't forecast it too much, but we do -- we did see pick-up and we saw really that we got into the consideration set for more purchases. When something's available in one day or less, now you really don't have to go to a store even if you need it very quickly. So, it just opens up more ways for us to serve our customers, especially our Prime customers. On your comment about international, yes, you're right, it was a larger loss than in prior quarters. In fact, we had flipped to positive operating income through the pandemic. A lot of that was again getting two years of volume growth on top of a one-year's -- current year cost structure. There's also a bit of a slowdown just in content and other things, although we're building that, we would have built it at a higher clip. But the long-term trends remain the same in international. It's a group that has a very different life -- we're in different stages in different countries. The established countries of Europe and Japan are further along, obviously, and they perform closer to the North America results. We have new countries. We've added a lot in the last few years, the investments in Brazil, the Middle East, Australia, and adjacent countries of Poland and Sweden within Europe. So those are all important investments, but they start as an investment. And they -- we build over time and we front-load a lot of Prime benefits in those countries, especially things like video. We find video as a really strong, excuse me, attractor of customers and it's a gateway to Prime in a lot of those countries. So, the model is a bit flipped as versus what we saw in North America, just because we added video later in the game. But we like what we see and we see the actual the hours watched in the percent of Prime members who watch video is actually higher in a lot of the countries, the new countries that we're getting into. So, we're - as we said, we're going to make money long-term in international. Right now, it's a bit of an umbrella that catches a lot of different countries in different stages. We're happy with both the established countries. They are also seeing, however, the pressures that we're seeing in United States on labor and cost and disruption from supply chains.", "354": " Please proceed with your question.Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, just curious, how have you fared in pulling holiday shopping earlier thus far this quarter? And to what degree can that help ease some of the impact? And perhaps, what did you learn there last year from having Prime Day in 4Q? And then can you just also talk a little bit about the drivers of AWS acceleration and how you think about the margin profile with more contribution from enterprise deals? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Yes. Let's start with the holiday shopping. So yes, you're right. Last year, we -- as we look back, we used Prime Day to pull a lot of holiday shopping forward. And people knew that delivery capacity across all retailers was going to be tight, so it was more distributed to the quarter. Obviously, that works better for us than to have it all hit in a few concentrated weeks around Cyber Monday and Black Friday and the week before and two weeks after. So operationally, it's easier to perform when the volume is spread out. You are seeing a lot of promotional activity from us in October. Again, trying to do what we did last year, just pulled some demand to get people to buy and to buy early. We think that's to their advantage. Although we're preparing to serve people throughout the whole quarter, we feel we've done a good job of lining up inventory commitments that are larger than normal. We've looked at getting more container capacity. We've been successful in that. We've accessed new ports and parts of entry into U.S. So, we're doing everything we can, granted it's at a cost penalty in many cases, but we are -- we feel good about being able to serve customers this Q4. Love it in October, but we will take it in November and December as well. On AWS, the acceleration, I would -- again, I would say that what we're seeing is, again, a lot of customers accelerate their journey to cloud based on the pandemic. Some of their spending was suppressed in 2020 as they -- it's different, some companies were booming. Disney, Zoom, Netflix, others that were more travel-related were suppressed in their demand. Then I think there's a general level of recovery across a lot of our customer base.", "355": " We add many new products. I highlighted a few of our machine learning products, so we feel really good about the acceleration in growth. We know there were some suppression last year, but it was -- the growth last year was still in the 28% to 32% - or excuse me, 28% to 33% range through on an FX-neutral basis through most of the year. On the margin side, the margins are going to be -- they're not going to fluctuate over time. There's a lot of moving parts. There is a lot of extensions of contracts and long-term commitments, which are great for our business and great for customers. So, there's negotiated long-term deals, there's also a lot of investment in new capacity in new regions to service high usage. We're certainly adding -- continuing to add to our sales force and marketing teams. And then the counterbalance on that is how well we run our data centers, what efficiencies we get, what cost reductions we get. So, it's always going to be varying. We like where we are and will not forecast forward. But again, they are apt to change, but we're working hard to keep them high and well passing through benefits and efficiencies to customers in lower pricing.Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, Brian. The first one, I wanted to kind of ask a big picture question about the retail business. I know there's a lot of extra costs sort of moving through the system now, but maybe can you just talk to us, big picture about any changes or factors that have changed the Company's view about the long-term profitability, the long-term return on invested capital of the retail business now, as opposed to at the end of 2019? Then the second one is on the physical stores. You have quite a few different formats and experiments going on in the physical stores. Talk to us about areas where you've seen sort of the most positive results from physical stores, where you're pleased as opposed to areas where you still see room for improvement in the physical store strategy. Thanks.Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with your comment on the, we'll call it the core retail business.", "356": " In fact, it's impossible and not productive to even try and separate advertising from third-party from retail. It's all, to us, part of a flywheel where we service customers. We do it in an efficient way and we earn their trust in their future business, and we fight that battle every day. And we look to expand the Prime program to build that flywheel. We look to add new products and services like grocery and video and music and the list is long. So, when you look at retail, certainly expensive right now, especially with the costs I\u2019ve laid out in Q3 and Q4, for us to service that business. However, we have other monetization vehicles, including advertising that if we do well, become a benefit to customers and to advertisers at the same time. That's what we work on. So that is an important part of our profitability structure. It's tied directly to happy customers and customers who are engaged in buying things. So, we don't separate those two. We do for some reasons. We want to make sure that we're understanding where our cost and where our profits happen to be. But we do realize it's all part of the same customer offering. So \u2013 and we like the return on investment flywheel. We do. We - I get to see investments in warehouses trucking programs, new offerings that we do in new country expansion. We segment those as much as we can into discrete decisions. And then we track them and make sure that not only are we delighting customers or delighting shareholders in the long-term. So, we feel good about that. Certainly, the cost of fulfillment in the last few months and what we forecast into the next quarter are not what we're happy about, but we see ourselves as the shock absorber, absorbing a lot of the costs, so that the customers not impacted and sellers are not impacted. And again, it's just quite limited options in the short run to impact your cost structure. Most companies would delay shipment or incur -- add fees or something. We don't think that is customer-centric nor productive. And we will get through this period and then we are committed to getting our cost structure down.Dave Fildes: And Brian, on that second question around the physical store strategy.", "357": " And each one of course has a name and the types of products they offer has its own differences. But I think when you step back, we've said that we want options for customers to be able to shop online and in-store. And I think you're seeing that probably most predominantly with the grocery offerings in the Whole Foods footprint that we've got out there. And we want to give customers choice and offer them the combination doing that online and in-store option, whatever works best. And the goal around this is really raise the bar for what customers can expect with this omni-channel experience. So, if you like the hybrid model and we're working on continuing to evolve on a lot of interesting in-store experiences that will resonate with customers. We know that customers like to have a choice to be able to do that. So, some of the things that we continue to be excited about and do a lot of work on are things like the Just Walk Out Technology, that's been in our Amazon Go stores and has now moved into some of our Amazon Fresh stores, just really eliminates, again, one of those things that people may not realize is such a hassle or a deterrent to shopping, waiting in line, and eliminating something that\u2019s really been positively received by customers as they use that technology. Another one, just as you enter these stores, there's technology we have now in a little over 70 of our physical retail stores like Amazon One, which is a contactless way for folks to enter stores using their palm to identify. So that's in, as I said, retail stores and Whole Foods stores. And so, keep looking for us to roll that out. And I\u2019d say with these technologies, too, there's opportunities beyond the Amazon physical store footprints that I mentioned. You're starting to see Just Walk Out going in sports and kind of large arena-type environments. And Amazon One is at some good locations. And both those technologies, I'm excited to employ them in Climate Pledge Arena here in Seattle. So, look for us to keep iterating on those and finding other new innovative ways for customers to enjoy unique shopping experience.Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can come back to two on the Q4 cost structure.", "358": " I appreciate all the comments upfront. I didn't know if we could go a little bit deeper. And then of the costs you're incurring late Q3 into Q4, how should investors think about a permanent nature to that cost structure versus a transient nature of the cost structure, either as an output of the macro environment or the unit environment in Q4? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Eric, for your questions. I will just start with the second one. So how should we think about the cost permanence? Certainly, on the labor front there, we estimate about half of the cost is permanent base wage. The other half is in incentives that we currently offer to attract workers. We're going to have to see. I think it's going to adjust -- we are going to have to adjust and work to lower our costs going forward, especially on things that we procure that may have gone up in price in the last few months. Mostly what I\u2019m talking about is kind of third-party things like trucking and steel for fulfillment center construction. So, we will be working on our cost structure for a while. If you're trying to do the bridge for Q4 year-over-year, a couple of things I would say, yes, the COVID costs are lower by $1.5 billion versus last year.Eric Sheridan: Q3, yes.Brian Olsavsky : Yes. If your Q4, excuse me, the 4 billion is going to be pure variance year-over-year. That's what we've identified, 2 billion roughly of labor inflation and 2 billion of operational disruption mostly through higher transportation costs. There are a couple of other items year-over-year. If you remember last year, we were running at nearly 100% capacity. That's not the ideal for us, but it has the benefit of being highly leveraged and can have other costs, but it's highly leveraged mathematically on a cost per unit shipped. As we get more into a normal buffer, so that we can handle swings in volumes, especially as we get closer to holiday cutoffs, but we generally run with more slack in the system. And we\u2019re kind of in a good fortunate for returning to maybe a more normal profile and space, this Q4 issues again on labor. So there's that.", "359": " So, some rather large items year-over-year, having given you a complete bridge, but that's what we're seeing.Dave Fildes: Yeah. I think that's right, $4 billion, the items you mentioned, $1 billion higher in content. Marketing costs, they were suppressed last year. For much of the year, you're starting to see those grow throughout 2021.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Dan Salmon: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. First, you mentioned growing customers use of Prime, more original programming coming, and the services you offer, continuing to expand. Do you see this demand, this new content, the new services having expanded to a point where a price increase for the Prime subscription begins to make sense? And then second, you mentioned the unboxed event earlier this week, number of new ad products announced there. Which among them do you expect to be most impactful to the overall advertising business? Thanks, guys.Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Dan. I\u2019m going to start with the first question on Prime. So yes, we're very excited about the current programming that\u2019s coming out in the back-end of this year, and also the prospect for 2022. We think it's a real step-up in options and quality and volume for our customers globally in the video side and very excited about it. And you're right, it does have a lot of value. I've nothing to discuss or announce around Prime price increases. But we always look at that. We look at the value where it's generally a country-by-country discussion. We look at the value we\u2019ve built. We look at the time since our last price increase. There\u2019s a lot of strategic factors involved obviously. But the main job is to build the value of Prime, and that's what we work on and video is a big part of that.Dave Fildes: Yes. And, Dan, on the second piece for advertising, I think, we still see there's a lot of opportunity in the biggest kind of bucket, if you will, of the current advertising revenue run rate.", "360": " So, a lot of work and it's still being done on the team there and being able to add value for customers. I\u2019d point to, there's a lot of excitement in the of video advertising area, I know we've talked about that in the past. It's growing quickly. It's not the biggest piece of that run rate that you see in there, but growing well. And I think just the technology, we're able to develop some of the relationships that we've been able to foster with things like live sports, the opportunities with the Fire TV device and the video community and where we can reach folks through those areas, it's really exciting. IMDb TV, our ad-supported channel is - continues to do really well. People really enjoy that. We recently expanded that beyond the U.S. for the first time to the UK. So, a lot of really good and interesting ideas and a lot of opportunities to grow in different ways with video.Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler: Hey, guys. Just two for me. So, you guys are always kind of beating the rest of e-commerce on speed of delivery across a wide set of SKUs, but there's a bunch of these new companies cropping up that are wiring up speedy same-day delivery for a lot of products from either their own warehouse or from various other retailers. Do you view that as a threat? And you have same-day offering in 15 cities. Does your same-day leverage kind of your existing fulfillment center footprint or do you have to kind of rethink the approach to get the speed down to that 30-minute window or wherever it's going to go? And the second question is just New World was a huge hit. So just any thoughts high-level on the overall strategy within gaming? Thanks.Dave Fildes: Yeah. I'll take the second question first related to games. So, I think as we mentioned at the top, really excited to get New World out there to more customers' hands and saw some really good momentum kind of an engagement coming out of the gate with customers there and some of the offerings like the Steam platform and Twitch as well. But if you step back, I think, look, we've said for a while now that gaming is obviously one of the fastest-growing industries in the entertainment space.", "361": " So, we developed and published games for customers through Amazon Games, which developed that New World. We're also leveraging the Flywheel -- the Amazon Flywheel, offering some exclusive and free content as part of Prime Gaming, so it\u2019s part of Prime benefits. You've got AWS, utilizing AWS servers to stream games with our Luna -- Amazon Luna offering. And then as I mentioned before, building this large, engaged, passionate gaming community online with Twitch. So, I think, again, kind of to my point about a lot of really interesting ideas when we're talking about video and the advertising space, it's a lot of different areas that can interrelate, serve different communities within the gaming area. And so, we're going to keep working on that, keep building and listening to customers on the games we've launched, and keep pushing forward with an exciting slate in the future.Brian Olsavsky: And then your first question on what I'll call ultra-fast delivery and other options in the market. We like our model. It's a rapidly evolving space. And obviously, we\u2019re customer-obsessed, but we also are competitor aware. We like the business that we have. We have over 170,000 products that customers, Prime customers can get within two hours from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and other stores that participate with us in over 5,000 cities and towns. So, we're well on our way to providing ultra-fast delivery for things that require ultra-fast, or things like groceries and others. And we see that expanding, but there will be room for multiple winners in the space. And as we say, there's -- you have to have a cost structure and a logistics network that will pay for the delivery over time. So, we see it as part of an offering that we offer to customers that ranges from two days to one day to two hours or one hour, in some cases. So, we like to meet customers where they are and when they need things, and we're working on speed consistently.Operator: Our final question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brent Thill: Thanks. On the advertising business, I'm curious, given some of the concerns in the supply chain, have you seen a pullback on the ad side?", "362": " We're actually -- again, we're seeing strong growth. Obviously, the Prime Day is always a really great advertising event as well. And then you saw a little bit of that in Q2 when we had Prime Day in Q2 this year and we're lapping Prime Day from Q4 of last year. So, there might be comparable issues, but as far as the strength of the offering and the differential between the growth of the advertising business versus the unit growth, we think we're really resonating with advertisers. We're given new products, new ways to advertise, new ways to highlight the brands. It\u2019s resonating with sellers as well for the same reasons. And we feel it's additive to the customer experience. It helps customers find curated selection and also see brands that they may not have otherwise seen. Dave Fildes Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months.", "363": " Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2022 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "364": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today's call. Before we move to questions, I will make some comments about our Q3 performance and the outlook for Q4. For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over-year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. As the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, the foreign exchange impact was higher than the 390 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q3 guidance. This represents a headwind of approximately $900 million, more than we initially guided to. Throughout the quarter, our worldwide stores business continued to stay highly focused on our customers and driving the inputs that matter most, which helped to accelerate sales growth in the quarter. We now offer our widest selection ever. We've taken actions that have driven strong recovery of in-stock rates, and we continue to work on improving delivery speeds, all while ensuring our pricing remains sharp for our customers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for consumers, representing 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever. It's up from 56% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our US conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools, including new e-mail marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates and new features and analytics to help sellers better understand and act on conversion-driving content. This was a big quarter for Prime members. We celebrated our eighth Prime Day in July, which contributed approximately 400 basis points to our Q3 year-over-year sales growth rate. Prime members purchased more than 300 million items worldwide, making it the biggest Prime Day net sales event in Amazon's history. As a reminder, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter of 2021. We also debut the two largest Prime Video releases ever.", "365": " And in the first two months since its launch, Rings of Power has driven more Prime sign-ups globally than any other Amazon Original. NFL Thursday Night Football also premiered in September, averaging more than 15 million viewers during its first broadcast, and driving the three biggest hours of US Prime sign-ups in the history of Amazon. Our next broadcast, the seventh of the 15-game schedule, kicks off in a few hours, with the Ravens visiting the Buccaneers. We also saw good growth in our advertising offerings where sales grew 30% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange as vendors and sellers have embraced our portfolio of products, which allow advertisers to build general awareness and/or drive sales of a specific product. In AWS, net sales increased to $20.5 billion in Q3, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of $82 billion. With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs. And we're proactively working to help customers cost optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS' history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tiers options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips. Graviton3 processors delivered 40% better price performance than comparable x86-based instances. And our teams across AWS continue to work relentlessly to expand that breadth and depth, including recent launches of new EC2 machine learning training instances in AWS IoT fleet-wise. And we continue to expand the AWS infrastructure footprint to support customers with the launch of the AWS Middle East region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific region in Thailand. Now, let's shift to operating income. During the quarter, we reported $2.5 billion in operating income. Turning first to our North America and international segments, during the quarter, we generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvements driven by higher leverage of our fixed cost base and continued productivity improvements in our fulfillment and transportation networks. This represents a solid improvement in productivity quarter-over-quarter, though not quite as much as we had planned.", "366": " We have identified initiatives that the teams continue to work hard on, and we expect to see further improvement in the quarters ahead. Another impact to operating income was the step-up in Prime Video content and marketing costs in Q3, primarily driven by the global premiere of the Rings of Power and the launch of the NFL Thursday Night Football package in the United States. Our results were also negatively impacted by non-recurring charges related to the closure of certain businesses and products such as Amazon Care, Fabric.com and Amazon Explore. We continue to ramp up our investments in AWS, adding product builders and sales and professional services headcount to help customers save money, invent more quickly in their businesses and transition to the cloud. We're also continuing to invest in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, expanding to new geographic regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Overall stock-based compensation expense was $5.6 billion in Q3, up from $5.2 billion in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate on certain unvested stock awards. We reported overall net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $1.1 billion included in non-operating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, the impact of this investment to our income statement is driven by quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. Now let's discuss capital investments, which is the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur approximately $60 billion in capital investments, which is broadly in line with what we spent in 2021. This represents an estimated reduction in fulfillment and transportation capital investments of approximately $10 billion compared to last year, as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand. And this is offset by an approximately $10 billion year-over-year increase in technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation and continued expansion of our AWS footprint. We also provided our fourth quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. While we are encouraged by our progress across the business, macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide.", "367": " As the third quarter progressed, we saw moderating sales growth across many of our businesses as well as the increased foreign currency headwinds, I mentioned earlier, and we expect these impacts to persist throughout the fourth quarter. As we've done at similar times in our history, we're also taking actions to tighten our belt, including pausing hiring in certain businesses and winding down products and services where we believe our resources are better spent elsewhere. We aim to strike the right balance between investing for our customers for the long-term, while driving operational efficiency improvements and accomplishing more with less. When faced with an uncertain economy or some kind of discontinuous event, customers tend to double-down on companies that they believe have the best customer experience and that take care of them the best. And that is where our efforts remain focused. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. We kicked off the season a few weeks ago with our first-ever Prime Early Access sales event where tens of millions of Prime members shopped and ordered more than 100 million items from Amazon's selling partners. We remain heads-down focused on driving a fantastic customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, let's move on to your questions.Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, maybe I'll just ask a two-parter with respect to the revenue guide for Q4. Can you help us better understand some of the comments you made around the exit velocity, specifically with respect to the US e-commerce business or the AWS business and how that might inform, some of the lower-than-seasonal trends that seem to be implied in the Q4 guide, specifically with respect to either optimizations on the AWS side or changes in consumption behavior on the US e-commerce side? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure thing, Eric. Thanks for your question. As I look ahead to guidance for Q4, I think the biggest individual factor is still going to be foreign exchange. This guidance includes 460 basis points of unfavorable impact year-over-year.", "368": " It actually has a slight favorability due to the investments we're making internationally. But put that aside for a moment. What we saw in Q3 was a really strong July with a great reaction to Prime Day globally. And the resumption of things like in-stock rates are starting to come back, and delivery speed was coming back. And that continued through the quarter, but growth rates started to slow a bit. And primarily in the consumer stores business, it was in international. North America, obviously, it was strong, but it started to slow a bit. But it was mostly in international where we saw the biggest impact, and we think that is tied to a tougher recessionary environment there. Compared to the US, it's worse in Europe right now. The Ukraine war and the energy crisis issues have really compounded in that geography. But when I talk about enterprise customers in AWS, yes, we've been working with customers to lower their bills. Just like all companies, they want to lower their spend when they're faced with uncertainty in the market. I would say one that's real valuable points about cloud computing is that it's turning fixed cost into variable for many of our customers, and we help them save money either through alternative services or Graviton3 chips. There's many ways that we have to help them lower their spending and still get great cost performance ratios. So what we're really excited about the business, both in the long term and even in the short run, you noticed we've added $4.5 billion to the $16 billion base we had of revenue last Q3, so the business is growing in absolute dollars at a really good clip. We do see some of the consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save money in the short run. I would say that although we had a 28% growth rate for the quarter for AWS, the back end of the quarter, we were more in the mid-20% growth rate. So we've carried that forecast through to the fourth quarter. We're not sure how it's going to play out, but that's generally our assumption. We're excited about the re:Invent conference that's coming up in late November. We expect to have over 40,000 people in Las Vegas and many more tuning in virtually.", "369": " Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Doug Anmuth: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, free cash flow generation has always been Amazon's focus in the past, but that went negative last year and likely this year as well. Can you just talk about the path to restoring meaningful free cash flow? And do you think that CapEx tied to data centers and the AWS ramp can ultimately step back, similar to what we've seen recently with fulfillment and transport? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. I think if you look at our free cash flow, there's multiple factors here. One is the drop-off in income for the trailing 12 months versus the 12 months before it, and a lot of that is driven to things that we've talked about on these calls. Ops cost, we\u2019re still not in a -- our network doubled over the last 2.5 years. While we're making strides in productivity and network optimization, we still work to do there. So we have to get our cost structure back to pre-pandemic levels in a lot of areas of the company and mostly in operations. There's a unique thing going on with inventory right now because we have a lot of weeks of cover mainly due to supply chain issues coming out of Asia primarily and we're seeing with our sellers, too. We just have additional weeks of cover. We think our model reacts quickly to customer demand. This is more about the other side of the equation, the supply chain and having more in stock. So what the issue there is that we generally have a favorable working capital impact from accounts payable that is more days than our inventory. That's been flipping the last year, and we expect that to normalize as we move into 2023. And then CapEx is a big driver. We had, again, a doubling of the network, had very high CapEx the last two years. You'll see that we've lowered CapEx year-over-year. We probably cut about one-third of our budget from what we originally thought for 2022 while still focusing our capital dollars really on the AWS business and increasing customer demand or capacity for increasing customer demand in our stores business. So we're working hard on all those dimensions.", "370": " Please proceed with your question.Mark Mahaney: Let me ask two profit questions. AWS margins were a little lower than we would have thought. Is that just a reflection of the full quarter impact of that stock-based compensation granted to those employees earlier in the year? Is that the new normal for AWS margins? And then international losses also were a little bit heavier than we thought, just talk about what drove those losses. And is that also the new normal for that segment? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with AWS. So we did see a deceleration or a drop in op margin sequentially quarter-over-quarter. The broad disclaimer on AWS margins is that they will fluctuate over time as we balance investments versus renegotiating pricing with the long-term customer commitments, all as headwinds to the business, offset by increasing productivity and efficiencies in our data centers, which drive profitability. So there's moving parts there. I'd say what's happening lately is, yes, the stock-based comp. We have seen inflation in our wages this year and particularly on our Czech employees is heavily concentrated in AWS. So that's one element of it. We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity and the impact of natural gas pricing. So those prices have up more than 2x over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus 2 years ago. So we're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. But we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy. And as we scale, we'll outrun that growth trajectory. On international, international is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. I think the biggest issue quarter-over-quarter, the increase in losses versus Q2 was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more certainly in the United States. And Prime Day always has lesser profitability because there's just a lot of deals. And it's a bit of margin from Prime Day in both North America and international. So a big part of that is device sales.", "371": " We don't make money on the device. We make money on the use of the device. So that always can end up hurting profitability in the quarter. So there are some contributing things. As far as new normal, we're working very hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal, and we'll see how quickly we can make improvements. A lot of the improvements that I talked about on a macro level, capital efficiency, operations improvements are as important internationally as they are in North America.Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brent Thill: Brian, on AWS, I'm just curious when you talk about optimizing and efficiency, can you talk to what you're seeing from your customers why perhaps you're seeing such a big pullback in terms of near-term demand? How would you characterize those conversations? And I think the other question is related to backlog. Backlog has been running 60-plus percent, so the divergence between revenue and backlog is pretty large. Everyone's asking, how do you describe that divergence?Brian Olsavsky: Let me have Dave answer the backlog question first.Dave Fildes: Yeah. It's Dave here. So I think our current backlog balance for Q3 is $104 billion. So it's about a little less than 60%, I think about 57% up year-over-year. And the new customer pipeline is healthy. I think with a lot of enterprises and customers, they're continuing to put plans in place. I think Brian will talk a little bit about some of the cost optimization in a second. Backlog growth, this figure, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter because it is dependent on the commitments that you sign in the period and how those adjust but, yes, $104.3 billion for the end of Q3.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. And your first question about cost optimization, first, there are some industries that have lower demand that's showing up in our volumes as probably like other companies as well, things like financial services, the mortgage business being down, cryptocurrencies being down. We're very strong in some of those industries, and that's part of it. But basically, what we see is customers are looking to save money versus their committed spend.", "372": " They can manage workloads better. They can switch to lower-cost products that have different performance profiles. They can switch to Graviton chips that have higher cost performance ratios. So, all really good things for the customer and for Amazon long-term. Again, we think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now, because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. And they can get about to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. So, I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. But the offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there were companies that went down and there's companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing high volumes during the pandemic. So, that dynamic is not in place right now, and I think everyone is just cautious and they want to, again, watch their spend. And as CFO, I appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon.Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.John Blackledge: That\u2019s great. Thanks. Two questions. First, could you provide some more details on the cost structure initiatives, and when we could see those initiatives hitting the P&L? And then second, on the holiday season. It's a bit implicit in your guide and remarks thus far, but just curious of your expectations for consumer demand this holiday season versus last year. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the holiday. So, we're ready to roll. We've got the best selection we've ever had. In-stock levels are really high. Delivery speeds are getting very close to where we want them to be. And we're ready to have a really good holiday season with our consumers this year. And the Prime Early Access sale, I think, created great value for consumers. It allowed them to get a jump on some of their purchases for the holiday and also just find some great deals. So, we're happy with that effort.", "373": " So, we're very optimistic about the holiday. But we're realistic that there's various factors weighing on people's wallets, and we're not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year. And we're ready for a variety of outcomes. But we know the consumers when they're looking for good deals, and that positions us well. Advertisers are looking for effective advertising. And our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend. So we have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers. So the seller in-stock is very high. We've had great in-stocks from our FBA sellers. And so we're ready to go. And we're very optimistic about the fourth quarter, just realistic about whether we may have a range of outcomes that we just have to be ready for when we are. On the cost structure initiatives, I think you're primarily talking about the operations world. We made -- there's three large buckets there, as I've said in the past, productivity, fixed cost leverage and inflation. On productivity, made good strides, but there's still a lot of work to do there and we know the job ahead of us. It's hard to improve productivity much in the fourth quarter, because it's just a period of like maximum stress on the operations, and we're trying to fulfill every order in a very quick way. But we\u2019re -- our goal is to leave ourselves in a really good, strong condition for a fast start on a lot of initiatives in Q1 of next year. On fixed cost leverage, we've taken steps to alter our forward plan and take CapEx out. A lot of the CapEx we spend in any given year is feeding future years' capability. And we've tightened that up. We feel good about the arc of demand versus supply that we have in our fulfillment and transportation area. Inflation is a wildcard. We do as much as we can to save money in an inflationary environment. We've looked to make sure that our trucks are fully utilized as best we can, preventing long-zone shipments, things that like use a lot of fuel or use a lot of trucking or use a lot of shipments from other parts of the world.", "374": " We're working very hard to save that. Those challenges will be there through the end of the year, and we'll be working on them definitely in the first half of next year as well. So we'll keep you posted as we have these quarterly calls on our progress and where we see opportunities.Operator: And our final question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler: Hey, guys. Just two clarifications on what you just said. So, first, on retail, you did see some good efficiency gains in 3Q, and you talked about $1.5 billion. As we look forward, if those three areas you just mentioned do turn favorable, how quickly do you think you could get back to kind of historical North America retail operating margins? Is that 1 year, two years? Any time frame on that? And then, on AWS, you said the back half of 3Q was a mid-20s run rate. One of your prominent peers was talking about incremental macro weakness in 4Q. So could you just talk about, are you expecting the same thing in 4Q, or are some of the price concessions you already made in 3Q kind of getting in front of that? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Was that second question on AWS, Ross?Ross Sandler: Yes, AWS trajectory. Exactly.Brian Olsavsky: Okay. Let me start with the efficiency. I just outlined a lot of it in the prior answer. But just to clarify, we were aiming for about $1.5 billion improvements sequentially versus Q2 and Q3. We feel like we came up about $0.5 billion short on that. Primarily -- mostly in our productivity we have a lot of -- with the Prime Day and the preparations for the Prime Early Access event, we have been running with very high inventory levels in our warehouses. But our inventory and our sellers, as we get ready for those events, paid off in the events themselves. In-stocks have been at really high levels. But in that environment, it's a little harder to work on. There's, blockages to making improvement in productivity. There's a lot of extra work when you have space constraints. But we will continue that fight. And while I can't forecast into 2023 yet, and I'm not really only talking about Q4.", "375": " Dave, do you want to take that question on AWS?Dave Fildes: Yeah, this is Dave. Ross, you were just asking around AWS. There's nothing really I'd add to what Brian had already said other than he's spoken about. We've seen the year-over-year growth rate come down as the third quarter progressed and exited in sort of the mid-20s growth rate. And so that's informed how we're thinking about the guidance ranges heading into the fourth quarter, but nothing else to add on that.End of Q&A: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.

After appearing to stabilize early in the quarter, our comps moderated over the last nine weeks driven by changes in both traffic and basket size. Our EPS miss was driven in large part by weaker-than-anticipated sales; however, we still delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 8% and healthy cash flow from operations of $132 million in our seasonally slowest sales quarter of the year. In the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still. As highlighted in our press release, we made measurable progress on many of our strategic initiatives over the past year, including using technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. For the fiscal year, we produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $970, over $1.3 billion in EBITDA, a record $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and a 15% return on invested capital. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning close to $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the year with approximately $582 million in cash and investments. Whole Foods Market has been a driving force in elevating food consciousness and raising the bar on quality standards for 35+ years; we have a proven track record of delivering long-term shareholder value, and our tremendous success has bred increased competition. Our partners at United Natural Foods estimated over 70,000 new points of retail for natural and organic products over the last three years. In this dynamic and increasingly competitive marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper in creating a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. Later, I will outline the decisive steps we are taking to enrich the customer experience and gain efficiencies in our overall cost structure. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Some would say that increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters. The reality is Whole Foods Market sells the highest quality food in the world, our standards lead the industry and our selection and in-store experience cannot be matched by the competition.", "378": " We believe values matter. It's what our customers tell us they love most about us, and we're not changing that. One of the things we are doing is launching 365 by Whole Foods Market, a complementary brand that will broaden our reach to new customers and new markets. Guided by the same industry-leading quality standards, our 365 stores will allow us to address the value-quality proposition in a new way, while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. There's never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who's growing it. I believe we'll look back on 2015 and recognize it as the tipping point of a food revolution in this country, about the direct connection between what you eat, and your health and well-being. At the same time, food retailing is rapidly evolving in new ways \u2013 from online delivery in one hour, to click and collect, to personal shoppers. Some now estimate online sales could grow from 2.5% of total food retail sales to 8%, or $100 billion, by the year 2025. Going forward, we envision a fusion of the store experience and technology, with the customer at the center. No one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We will keep innovating and creating environments where people can connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of a differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on quality and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability, and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. As the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods is awakening, and the ways in which people want to buy their food evolve, the market opportunity is continuing to expand. There will be more than one winner. It's not a zero-sum game. Our company mission, commitment to transparency, and culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever, and where our company is today is just a fraction of where we think we'll be 20 years from now. As I highlighted earlier, while we're making progress on many of our initiatives, in this dynamic marketplace we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper to rebuild traffic and sales and create a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth.", "379": " One, we are committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business and have already taken steps in this direction. We have a plan to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are systematically looking at every aspect of our business to eliminate costs that do not produce value for our customers. We recently eliminated more than 2,000 positions, are transforming our purchasing operations to allow us to function more productively, to be more competitive and better leverage our growing size and scale, and are looking for similar opportunities in other key areas. We have also introduced a new labor-scheduling tool to our customer service teams, with plans to expand to additional teams over the next year. Number two, we will innovate faster to further differentiate the Whole Foods Market shopping experience, with a focus on our exclusive brands and prepared foods. We are operating some of the highest volume restaurants in the country, and no house brand comes close to the quality standards of our exclusive brand products. Totaling close to $5 billion, or one-third of our sales, our exclusive brands and prepared foods are key differentiators for us, and we plan to partner with our suppliers to widen our competitive advantage in these areas. As part of this initiative, we have created a new Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality position, which we expect to fill in the coming months. Number three, we will improve our value perception through increased promotional activity and selective and strategic price reductions. We will utilize new talent, tools and systems, as well as consumer insights, benchmarks, and KPI progress reporting, to better track how our promotions and investments resonate with customers and impact our results. Number four, we will support our differentiation and value strategies through enhanced external marketing efforts. We will use media to support our pricing efforts across all major markets, clearly communicating not only our pricing investments but our quality as well. We will holistically address the way in which we communicate our value and values to our customers at every touch point, including our online, digital and social platforms. Number five, we will invest in digital strategies to convert the strong traffic we generate online into sales. We have integrated Instacart into our app, will soon launch a national sales flyer, and will continue to make upgrades to provide more functionality and streamline our customers' digital experience. We have been very pleased with our affinity pilot, in terms of the information we are gathering and the sales lift it is generating.", "380": " Number six, we will invest in our technology platforms to provide a better shopping experience and enable us to run our business more efficiently. We will replace our disparate core legacy platforms with unified scalable solutions. The rollout of One POS system to all U.S. stores by the end of calendar 2016 will provide faster checkout times, improved labor productivity, and better data visibility across all channels. In addition, it will enable us to provide personalized offers and new experiences at checkout via our mobile app. We also just launched our groundbreaking partnership with Infor to co-create a next-generation cloud-based retail, merchandising and supply chain management platform. Admittedly behind in this area, this new retail platform will be unlike anything available today and will bring us many new capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, retail space planning and price optimization. Number seven, we will launch our second growth vehicle, 365 by Whole Foods Market. With eight leases signed to date, we plan to open three stores in fiscal year 2016 and up to 10 stores in fiscal year 2017. The time is right to take the high quality standards we have developed over the last 35+ years, and make them more broadly accessible through a streamlined, value-focused format and serve communities we would not be able to reach with our larger Whole Foods Market stores. Number eight, while we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we will increase our square footage at a more moderate pace this year. Having consecutively accelerated our store openings over the past six years, we plan to grow our square footage at a more moderate pace in fiscal year 2016, which will lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our comps and allow us to focus on the other areas we have outlined. Number nine, we will continue to affirm our culture. Our 91,000 team members are the heart and soul of our company and the not-so-secret ingredient in creating our customer experience. We believe our full time ratio is among the highest, and our turnover is among the lowest in the industry. And we will continue to invest in our team members' development and growth, including creating thousands of new jobs over the coming year. I will now turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2016, which reflects the impact of these initiatives.", "381": " While we have seen some stabilization in our two-year comp trends since the end of the fourth quarter, it has only been five weeks. We're hopeful that our comps will improve over the course of the year, given our toughest comparison is in the first quarter, and many of our sales-building initiatives are still gaining traction or are planned to roll out later this year. The higher end of our sales outlook reflects a 2.8% two-year comp, in line with the current run rate, and implies flat comps for the year, improving from negative 2% in Q1, to relatively flat in Q2 and Q3, to 3% positive by Q4. The lower end of our sales outlook reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year. Primarily reflecting our value efforts, we expect the decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, to be greater than last year's 45 basis points decline. While we have identified SG&A improvements of approximately 60 basis points, including the impact of the recent restructuring, we expect these savings to be more than offset by the cost of initiatives to drive traffic and sales, as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other costs. Therefore, we expect a decline in operating margin of up to 75 basis points from the 6.1% we reported last year, excluding charges. As we announced today, our board approved an additional $1 billion in stock buyback authority, and our intent is to spend the majority of that in the first half of the year. Excluding an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 per share in net accretion related to these debt-financed buybacks, we expect EPS for the fiscal year of $1.50 or greater. We will be facing our toughest comp and earnings comparisons in the first quarter and estimate approximately $0.01 per share in costs associated with the recent restructuring. I know that we have shared a lot of information with you today, but before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we recognize we have our work cut out for us. We believe we are taking the necessary steps to regain our sales momentum, fundamentally evolve our business model, and produce the returns that the investment community expects from us, and that we expect from ourselves. We will now take questions.", "382": " Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go first to Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. So my one question has to do with share buybacks. I just wanted to understand the rationale for taking on debt and buying back shares right now maybe instead of waiting until maybe comp trends stabilized. So if you could maybe help us with your thought process.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We think Whole Foods is a compelling buy at these prices. Stock buybacks are going to be accretive in the short-term and the long-term. And it doesn't preclude us from making further stock buybacks in the future if necessary.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's sort of a perfect situation, Rupesh, this is Glenda, with interest rates being what they are and the long-term debt market being what it is and our trading metrics \u2013 stock price trading metrics, relative to history being what they are. And we have very strong cash flow and are very confident in our ability to service the debt and to continue to fund our growth out of our own cash flow.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: And also that we structured the debt in this way, the debt buyback in this way, where we have the flexibility over time to use it as we want to use it, when we want to use it.Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. I'm going to ask one more question quickly. You laid out a number of sales initiatives in your prepared comments. So if you look out the next couple of quarters, what are the key sales initiatives you believe can help to drive traction? Especially on your top line as the fiscal year progresses?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: If we had a magic bullet we've already shot it. We don't think there's anything we can do immediately except increase promotional activity to drive sales. We think it's basic blocking and tackling. We're going to get back to basics at Whole Foods.", "383": " We're re-examining our business, and we're systematically working, basically, to cut costs that aren't going to create value for our customers. And then we can invest a lot of that in promotions and into strategic lower prices. So part of it'll be pricing, part of it is going to be marketing. We're going to support our strategic price investments and promotions with marketing around the country, so we're upping our marketing spend this year. And, you want to add some more color to that, Dave?David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah. Operations, I would say, this is David. So we're really eyes on the price, focusing on execution. So looking at our in-stock position. We have a new out-of-stock tool that we've implemented across all stores to make sure that when our customers are in a store they can always buy the products that they want. This has been very helpful with our friends at Instacart to increase our now record sales through Instacart. So things like that. Operations with the new labor scheduling tool which we're expanding beyond customer service into our grocery department and our whole body departments. So just-in-time scheduling to make sure we're really taking care of our customers and eyes on the prize, focusing on results, focusing on operations.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: Yeah. One other point that I want to make \u2013 this is Ken \u2013 is bringing on the GDP of culinary and hospitality and recognizing that prepared foods and bakery are significant differentiation points for us, having leadership around that where we set really strong guidelines around culinary expectations, reset the expectation on hospitality in our stores, really develop partnerships with restaurateurs that are going to create differentiation for us. We really feel like that's going to be an incredible sales driver for us and a differentiation point for us over the next year.Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you, and good luck with your efforts.Ken Meyer - Executive Vice President, Operations: Thank you.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Rupesh.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "384": " I would like to talk a little bit about the changes you're making in the cost structure, especially you talked about procurement, but other areas. You've had a very successful model of being regionalized. And I'm just wondering, how do you maintain the creativity, the great shopping experience, the localization, if you centralize certain things to take cost out?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Meredith, that such a good question. And there's very few questions that Whole Foods Market is thinking about deeper than that and continuing to dialogue about it because we know we need to evolve our business model. And we know in many cases such as purchasing we want to take advantage of our scale. We have a redundancy built into the system. So the art of what we're trying to do is we want to evolve the structure in such a way that we take out redundancy and waste, and at the same time though, we're not diminishing the culture, the empowerment efforts that make Whole Foods Market special. And that just means we have to proceed very thoughtfully, very carefully, and we have to be very inclusive in making the decisions so the voices are heard. That means Whole Foods does move, sometimes it can move a little bit slowly, but it means often times we'll make better decisions because of the inclusive nature of it. But it was a good question because we are thinking deeply about it. And I think the fact that we're so conscious of it means that we're less likely to just do something inadvertently to screw it up. But we are determined to evolve. So we are going to evolve, but we're going to take our culture with it.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, this is Walter. Just to add to that is you asked which areas. We're looking at every single functional area across the company. Obviously, at this point we've grown to be close to $16 billion a year in sales. All those functions have evolved over time, as you see, in different ways and in different regions.", "385": " So that's the nature of the conversation. So in answer to your question, we're looking at TMS, HR. We're looking at marketing. We're looking at purchasing. We actually have a very evolved plan for exactly how purchasing is going to unfold. And I think trying to capture the best of both worlds in making those changes to pick up the savings, to pick up the advantage of our size and scale, to function more efficiently and productively but still maintaining that wonderful freedom, empowerment at the store level for team members to serve customers.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: David, just a couple of examples to think about. Its also we have the ability to eliminate some positions because we no longer need it based on technological things we've put in our stores. For example, the new labor scheduling tool, in the big stores, one of our big New York City stores, you might have somebody working 40 hours a week on the labor schedule just for the customer service team, just the cashiers. Now we have \u2013 our new system actually predicts the scheduling so we probably can reduce that to 20 hours instead of 40 hours. So that's just cost we can take out of the system without radically changing our culture at all.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: And one more thing I'd like to add specifically to purchasing. I do believe that there's been great strength in the decentralization that we've had in our purchasing teams, especially in the perishable areas. And at this point, we see pretty much for the perishables, for produce, meat and seafood, they will be still largely directed by the regional teams with the global teams helping them on that. So the real exciting stuff in the store is pretty much still going to be mostly run by the regional teams. It's really in the center store where we're looking at doing a lot more \u2013 bringing a lot more responsibility for center store products to the global team. Why that makes sense is that we work with our very large center store suppliers and we feel like we can most efficiently work with them and have the best partnership with them at the global level, but there'll still be a strong regional component.", "386": " That's very helpful.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Great. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my question, guys. Maybe turning to the other margin, the gross margin, just wanted to get a little bit more sense here. I know you said that you're expecting gross margins to be down a bit further next year as compared to this year. In the past \u2013 and I know that's, of course, primarily on value efforts \u2013 but in the past you've said that basically some things you've done have given the lift that's wanted and other things that you felt you probably didn't need to do. So could you just give us maybe a little bit more sense for whether it's by category, product, et cetera, kind of your learnings so far in several quarters now that these value efforts have been more of a focus. What's working the best, what you need to do some more work on, and the thoughts going into next year specifically?A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Hi, A.C. Good question. What we have found when we've looked at \u2013 we've been doing some margin investments every year for the last three years. We ramped it up a little bit in 2015 and plan on doing even more in 2016. Where we've seen the best results is in \u2013 whatever category it's in has been through promotions. We've done experiments with lowering everyday prices and trying to set certain categories at certain places but we found, for the most part, that our customers react best to promotional activity and so that's where we really look to focus ourselves going forward. This past year we did pick certain markets and we did a lot more produce promotions and we were happy with what we saw there so we'd love to do more this year again, and also across other teams as well.Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, A.C.Operator: Thank you. We'll move next to Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. I guess over two years ago you talked about a common POS system and said it would take 18 months to 24 months.", "387": " What caused those initiatives to fall behind by so much and does your current guidance for initiatives have, I guess, more conservatism around the timing?Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: Hi. This is Jason. When we gave the initial guidance we talked about what it would take to get into our initial stores. We're currently in 18 stores with our one point of sale program. We went to that first store at the beginning of this year and so we think we've got a pretty conservative timeline that we've put in our guidance for today. As it relates to the affinity program, as mentioned, we really are very positive on the results that we've seen so far with the program. Our opportunity here is to make sure that we've got one that has got the right cost structure in place for us and has the right win-win and value propositions for the customer. We're continuing to evolve a few more different tests and we are very optimistic on being able to bring this to all of our customers before the beginning of next calendar year as we mentioned.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. That's my one question.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hello. What percent of the stores square footage would you say right now is at an appropriate pricing level? And then as a second part to that, didn't you all have a marketing campaign you kicked off last year at this time and I'm curious if that was pulled back during the course of the fiscal year? Thank you.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: We don't really know how to answer that first question. What percentage of our stores is at the right pricing level? Does anybody else? I can't answer it.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we look at it more broadly at our overall competitive position and as A.C. mentioned earlier, obviously laying out tracks to invest strategically and systematically this year through both promos and lower prices, but I think for competitive reasons we would leave it more general than that.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: But also the hard \u2013 the reason that's quite a hard question is that it's really different in different markets and different competitors.", "388": " So it's really a varied process that goes on so I think for all retailers in that type of condition.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: It's David, the other thing I would say from operation as well as purchasing is it's a two-pronged thing. We focus on being competitive on prices but we also focus on differentiation and press for advantage. So we have a fully differentiated product line like our meat standards, our prepared foods where we have scratched production unlike any of our other competitors. We can press that advantage. So we're trying to expand the amount of items that are not \u2013 we don't have to be as price competitive on because they are fully differentiated. We're looking on all other product lines right now to see what products we can add to be fully differentiated.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Having said, we significantly improved our price tracking tools, our competitive tracking tools. We've expanded the amount of items in there. This team has worked to upgrade all that reporting that gives us every two weeks snapshot and exactly where we stand relative to the various competitors in the various markets as A.C. said. We've got better tools than we've ever had to see exactly where we stand and where price relevancy where we need to move on price relevancy. And I also want to underscore David's point about the strategy here is around being a quality grocer. We are the highest-quality grocer in the United States and that's who we are, that's what we stand on and we're going to combine that with price relevancy but we're going to stand on the fact that we sell the best stuff.David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And on the marketing campaign? Is the next one going to be a lot different than what you did last year at this time?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the thinking was on the campaign is the timing was off to do it. Right now we had other things to take care of and to put in order and as we think through \u2013 we've already thought through what we think that next message will be but obviously, no, it won't be the same message.", "389": " So we'll also have the new digital platforms available too, as well to carry those messages, not just TV but workers as I think somebody mentioned earlier we'll be launching our digital flyer next year that will be nationwide.David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the e-commerce front and by the way thank you for quoting from our e-commerce report at the front of your comments. I wanted to find out how deep you are on Instacart right now. What percentage of your sales is derived from e-commerce right now? And how many of the stores are really covered by Instacart at this point?Jason J. Buechel - Chief Information Officer & Executive VP: This is Jason. We don't actually disclose our percentage of sales at this point. We do have an all-time record high. We've just hit the $2.5 million mark which is the average sales of our last four weeks. We also have over 50 of our stores right now that are part of our we call it embedded shopper program that provides in a delivery radius.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: David, also I would say anecdotally we've had stores up to 15% of store sales are closing in on $100 basket size for Instacart. So those are individual stores, but it shows a path to where we can get to.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And how do you stand on getting prepared foods rolled out?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we've been doing a number of tests in that particular space. As you know, the time frames which people want those delivered are in a very immediate timeframe. So it's something that we've been testing out in our SoMa store in San Francisco and look to scale various elements as we find success there.Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks.", "390": " You talked about a lot of new and interesting initiatives today, so I wanted to figure out the balance on that. What have you been doing that's not basics, so to speak? I don't know if that means it's been a distraction or what. And are there efforts you'll pull back on as you build out others? Just trying to get a sense of what may go away as you start new things?John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a good question, Ken. So by basics what I meant on blocking and tackling, I mean retail ultimately always comes down to how satisfied the customer is. So it's about retail is detail is the clich\u00e9, and it's a very appropriate one. Things like the level of customer service, the level of in-stocks that we have in our products, how the stores look, the overall feeling they have when they're in the stores, the cleanliness of the stores. Everything has to do with upgrading the customer experience, from signage to the way we communicate. The message is how the prepared foods taste. It's making sure that we're executing operationally at a very high standard. So that's what I mean by getting back to basics. That doesn't conflict with our need to evolve and to introduce all these new initiatives to evolve our business model. I think those are complementary to each other, but they have to be on the foundation of very strong operations. It's ultimately satisfied customers who are your best form of advertising that you have. They're the ones that tell their friends, and a loyal customer comes back every week and their basket size is going up. I'm not going to say Whole Foods neglected that. I don't think we've neglected it, but I think we need to up our game. We're going to get better at it.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: Working with our regional presidents who are doing a spectacular job on some of these cost reductions, they're really focusing on anything that takes the store team leaders out of the store. So we're \u2013 a big frugality push on travel and focusing on getting our store team leaders to eliminating days they're not in the stores.", "391": " Anything that's extra credit or a distraction, we are refocusing that back on taking care of our customers.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Walter, and I'll just add to your question, Ken. Kind of book-ending on John's comments, is that if you're to look at the focus on the basic, but you support that by fundamentally relooking at the way you do work. So that is the structure of jobs, it is the processes we use, the redundancies that might exist. And you say to yourself, how can we do this work? How can we make this work simpler so that the worker really focusing on the customers and each other can continue to happen in a more efficient and productive way. And I think that's the effort of the overall looking at the business. And I think the second thing is using technology, because clearly these investments, these three platform decisions we've made, whether it's Workday on the TMS or HR side, the One POS on the front end side, and then also the Infor on the supply and merchandising side, all three of those things are going to make work a lot easier to do with more transparency. They're going to be ultimately supportive of having the team members to be able to focus on the customer experience and the work happen more efficiently. So it's combining the future ideas with the core, as John said. And third, I think we all know now that the door to the store is not just at the physical, it's also a digital door. And we've got work to do to take that same in-store experience that we have created so well over the years and take that and extend it onto the digital platforms where our customers come. We have 6 million visitors a month to our website. That's a pretty high number for a supermarket. And relative to our \u2013 so we have opportunities to convert those and continue to build trips through that, so essentially extending experience and having a digital door to Whole Foods as well as a physical store.Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks so much.Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking my question.", "392": " And I guess if you look at the industry, somebody like Kroger has proven over time with Walmart that you don't need to be in-line with competition from a pricing standpoint to reach an equilibrium in total value. I'm sure that applies to your model as well, but the real question here is just, how are you thinking about the appropriate level of gross margin in this business now longer-term? You used to talk about, I think it was 34%, 35%. Where do we stand on that? Just thoughts there would be helpful, I think.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: A good question. That's another good question because that's something we're continually talking about and strategizing about and evolving our position on it. But, first thing I would say is that a lot of the folks that are copying Whole Foods at this point, they are not copying our quality standards, they are copying our look and feel and our marketing. And so far, that's a good strategy; it's working. Many customers are not looking beneath the hood; they're not seeing the differences. So one of the challenges Whole Foods has to do a better job at is communicating our superior quality. The differentiation, it's there. It's definitely there in the perishables, from our animal welfare system in meat to our sustainable seafood to our responsibly-grown produce. So we have to do a better job of connecting to our customers to get them to understand that these are not the same things. They may look like they're the same, but they're not. And we don't want to have a race to the bottom; we don't want to compromise our quality and start cutting our quality to make us more competitive on price. Sure, if you're in the center store and if they have exactly the same items then you're absolutely right, we have to be price-relevant, we have to be very close or matched on those items, and we're working on that.", "393": " We are not laying out the chapter and verse exactly where that's happening for competitive reasons, but you can see in the guidance it reflects the decline in the gross margin reflecting aggressive activity. So obviously in your question, what we're seeing is we're moving the needle this year. We probably expect to move the needle next year, although we have to see exactly what works, how it works, how the customers respond to the particular combination of value and quality. So I think we're focusing right now on what we're telling you for fiscal 2016 and how we see our steps taking there.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: One of the challenges we've got, to be honest, is that it's hard to comp when you're $1,000 a square foot. It's a lot harder to build a high comp on that than it is to build a 4% or 5% comp at $500 a square foot. Just have a lot more running room, stores are less congested, it's just easier to do. And while we do think we can increase our comps and we do think we can increase our sales per square foot, it's just our success has become a higher hurdle for us to jump over. And if you're starting in a lower base, as many of our competitors are, it's easy to show a higher comp number. The question is, can you continue to show it? We showed 8%, 9% comps for 20 consecutive years, just about. So our challenge, and it's a big challenge, is what I started out by saying. We have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation so the customers understand our quality superiority and at the same time where there are no significant differentiating advantages, there is no quality standard differential. Well, A, that's a challenge to differentiate and up the quality standard but in many cases it means being more price relevant and those are the two things we intend to do a better job at both definitely going forwardEdward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll take our final question from Chuck Grom with Sterne, Agee CRT. Please go ahead.Renato Basanta - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi, guys.", "394": " Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to flesh out the price investments here a little bit. Can you just give us some specifics in terms of what percentage of markets or stores you currently have the permitter (44:27) price investments in. What you're planning going forward in terms of additional rollouts, maybe what kind of elasticity you've been seeing in terms of these investments? And then finally just your thoughts on how deep or broad-based the investments may need to be to get the desired effect on the volume front.A.C. Gallo - President & Chief Operating Officer: Hi. A.C. here. We've made \u2013 I would say price investments, we've made across all of our stores. We did focus, as we said, we did focus certain produce price investments this past year in certain markets, four markets in particular then we added a fifth one later in the year. And we are happy with the results in that and are looking to maintain and expand that this year in produce. And we're also looking to do increased promotions throughout a lot of other parts of the company and specifically where we do them and really depends on as I was saying earlier, every market is different and so we'll focus produce promotions more in some markets. We'll do more meat and seafood in other markets and grocery in other ones. It's really a very thought through careful strategy that you do, that we'll do in each market depending on the needs that we have there.David Lannon - Executive Vice President, Operations: This is David. I guess one more thing I would just say is that one thing we have been learning over the last few months is that the more promos that we do together where promos that affect the whole company from our recent customer focus Love Fest promotion that amplified the effect because we can put out through all the digital channels the connection on price so that price is marketed across the entire company. So we're looking at more and more ways that we can amplify by doing promotions together.Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: I guess to close that off and just, again, reiterate what John said at the end when we opened up around, this team is really committed to rebuilding the sales momentum.", "395": " So but make no mistake this team recognizes we're not where we want to be right now with respect to sales. We intend to move on that and hopefully you have some more confidence from this conversation today at exactly the steps that we're going to take.John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. Please visit Whole Foods Market in-store and online for the best selection of fresh healthy holiday meals and join us in February for our first quarter earnings call.

Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q4, sales increased 2% to a record $3.5 billion. We opened five new stores, including two 365 stores. We continued to make selective investments on key items to narrow pricing gaps while offering strong weekly deals, which were supported by the continuation of our enhanced ad campaign. We also successfully launched our new affinity rewards program in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. In a heightened competitive and promotional environment, we have remained focused on our initiatives to build sales over the long-term and are seeing encouraging signs of customers responding, as reflected in our third consecutive quarter of improving items per basket. As our value, personalization and marketing efforts gain traction and new sales-building initiatives roll out throughout the year, we expect our traffic trends to improve as well. In a challenging operating environment, we maintained our expense disciplines, delivering 8% EBITDA margin, $0.28 in earnings per share and $352 million in operating cash flow. As highlighted in our press release, we have made measurable progress this year on our nine-point plan to position Whole Foods Market for continued success in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This includes one of our most important initiatives, which is to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are pleased to report that as of year-end, we are more than 50% of the way toward our goal. The biggest reductions to-date have been achieved through various labor saving measures, including evolving our marketing and HR functions from a store to a metro model, reducing buying positions as we transform our purchasing operations and combining certain store teams, such as meat and seafood in lower volume stores. Many of these efforts allow us to focus our store labor investments where they are most needed, ensuring product availability, maintaining high standards and serving our customers. In addition to labor and benefit savings, we significantly reduced our supplies and packaging expense through a more consolidated purchasing program across regions. Another major accomplishment was the launch of our new value format, 365 by Whole Foods Market. We're using the learnings from our first three stores to shape and evolve our next round of 365 openings. And we're excited about the opportunities this streamlined operating model presents for our existing and future Whole Foods Market stores as well.", "398": " This was a significant undertaking involving the conversion of more than 6,200 checkout lanes. This system provides the foundation to enhance our promotional capabilities, including more dynamic and personalized offers through our mobile app and rewards programs. As we evolve our business model, our commitment to our core values, mission and culture has never been stronger. And we appreciate our team members for continuing to deliver a world-class shopping experience to our customers. In a year that presented many ongoing headwinds for food retailers, including deflation, increased competition from existing as well as new business models and lackluster consumer demand, we produced industry-leading sales per square foot of $915 and a healthy 13% return on invested capital. While sales were lighter than forecast, we achieved many of the fiscal year targets we provided in Q4 last year, including $1.52 in earnings per share, excluding buybacks, and an 8.6% EBITDA margin. We produced more than $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and invested $716 million of capital primarily in new and existing stores and technology initiatives, resulting in $400 million of free cash flow; and in keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017, we expect sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5% and earnings per share, excluding potential future buybacks of $1.42 or greater. Our priorities include, progressing to an always on unified marketing and media plan; using insights from our customer data and analytics to improve the relevancy, effectiveness and efficiency of our value and marketing investments; intensifying our personalization efforts, including a rollout of our optimized rewards program to all U.S. stores; taking a more strategic approach to our assortments, pricing and promotions, including the continued development of category management tools, processes and capabilities to better inform our investments; evolving our purchasing structure to a hybrid model, with global teams leading our category management efforts and regional teams focused on local products; leveraging our new culinary team's leadership and expertise to offer a full spectrum of the highest quality, readymade meal solutions, in-store or delivered to your door, including a pilot for curated meal kits; and offering our customers more convenience through expanded online delivery to more cities and additional ZIP Codes in existing markets.", "399": " Our new stores on average continue to be profitable in year one and we have many other exciting openings this year, including Bryant Park in New York City in January and Lakeview, Chicago this spring. At the same time, we believe it is prudent in this challenging retail environment to continue to moderate our lease signings, ending square footage growth and capital expenditures as a percentage of sales. We have seen stability in comps over the last two quarters and an improvement in trends quarter-to-date for both traffic and basket size. We are encouraged that our value and marketing efforts appear to be gaining traction with customers and believe we will see momentum as our sales-building initiatives are rolled out throughout the year. The competitive landscape is very dynamic, however, and it is uncertain how long the deflationary environment will continue. The high end of our negative 2% to flat comp range reflects a negative 2.5% two-year comp, slightly better than Q4's negative 2.8%. While the low end reflects the possibility that two-year trends could get marginally worse before they get better, as we have seen quarter-to-date. As we have stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversion we have about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure through enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We expect to reach our goal, but expect these savings to be more than offset by our investments to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other cost. Therefore, we expect a decline in operating margin of up to 60 basis points for the year, with greater declines in the first half, primarily related to higher year-over-year pre-opening expense in the first quarter and marketing expense in the first and second quarters. Please see our press release for more detailed guidance. In closing, food retail is evolving at an incredibly fast pace, and consumers have many more options for how and where they buy their food than ever before. At the same time, the market opportunity is expanding as the consciousness about fresh healthy foods continues to awaken. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and the culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever.", "400": " We sell the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry, and no one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We continue to see strong customer reception to our brand in new and existing markets as evidenced by recent openings. Our stores are highly profitable with only seven out of 456 stores at year-end not producing positive EBITDA before rent. We will keep innovating and creating opportunities for people to connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of a differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on our quality standards and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. We believe we have the right strategies in place to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long-term. In a separate release today, we announced some coming structural and leadership changes. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate both Walter and Glenda for their many years of partnership and service to the company. The significance of their countless contributions cannot be overstated, and we are grateful that both will continue to be involved in shaping our future. We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you.Operator: Your first question is from Karen Short from Barclays.Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, I mean obviously with Walter and Glenda departing, that must have been a very tough decision for you and \u2013 I mean for the company. But maybe any color on that in general. And then what thoughts are related to CFO search? And then if there's any \u2013 John, I'm assuming you will be taking over the CEO role. So, just a little color there.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: This is Glenda. I'll go first. For me, I've been with Whole Foods or I will have been with Whole Foods 29 years next year when I retire. I'll turn 63 this year, so that's almost half of my life.", "401": " So we will probably start the search process sometime in January.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: This is Walter, and how about them earnings. But I would say, I've also been here a few years and I think that \u2013 I think we have \u2013 life's not a straight line, but I think we have as a team, John and I and the team here that's around the table, we have really worked hard the last year to work through kind of the changes of the environment, the structural changes in retail. And I think you all know we've gone here or we've gone there trying to figure out exactly the right places to land. I think you can see in the coherence of the script today how it's really come together in a very thoughtful and strategic manner in terms of how we go forward. And we have a very optimistic view this coming year, and I think the board has decided, of course, John and I are on the board, that moving to a more streamlined structure is the right thing at this juncture to lead the company forward to the next level. And I will be here to continue to cheer that on, and I think that's where we are.Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Okay. We'll (13:52).John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: They covered it.Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much.Operator: Your next question is from Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes, hi. Good afternoon. I'd like to just dig into your commentary around value and marketing efforts beginning to gain traction and as it relates to basket and traffic. So your basket growth was fairly encouraging, actually, particularly against deflation, price investments. So what is this I guess saying about your most loyal customers and the recognition for the work that you're doing in the store? But then on the other side of that, traffic is still an issue. And what are your thoughts around why that's lagging? And then as it relates to that, Q1, it sounds like you talk about traffic getting better. I assume that means the traffic quarter-to-date is better than the 4.2% in Q4.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: So, this is Walter.", "402": " But the first one is on the baskets.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sorry.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: What's really \u2013 yes, you did a good job on that. The first one that's really exciting looking at these results is if you look across the quintile data for the baskets, every single basket was moving up. And so what that says is that there's some real stability here. And particularly in the $100 basket, it's showing some nice growth, showing that our most loyal customers are continuing to shop with us. And the cool thing about the data and analytics we have now is we can actually look into that $100 basket and we know what the drivers are in there. And we've got that to build on. Look, with respect to the \u2013 with respect \u2013 and that's a capability we never really had before. With respect to the trips, I mean it's \u2013 yes, clearly this is a challenging environment for retail in general on trips. But actually in this Q, we saw in the time period, we've seen an improvement. It's still not where we want it, but it has improved sequentially, and I think that we've always said we got to go items first, and from items we go to trips and I think we're going to come on strong with the marketing investments this year. Then I think you're going to be pleased to see with our new leader, Sonya Gafsi Oblisk, and we're going to really work hard to go right after those trips. So, I think items lead first and from them \u2013 and then comes the trips.Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the progress to-date. So, on the 365 stores, I just want to get an update in terms of how those are performing aggregate versus your expectations. And any early reads on cannibalization with your Bellevue location?David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. This is David. Yes, so cannibalization is lower in Bellevue than we had anticipated.", "403": " It's still early days for both those stores, so we opened Silver Lake six months ago or seven months ago, but then we \u2013 with Bellevue and Lake Oswego, it's early days, eight weeks and 12 weeks, so still pretty early in the learning cycle. But we're very excited about what we've seen so far. We've kind of built in a pause in the development cycle here till we open the next store in the spring in Austin. So we're learning from the data that we received from the customer shopping in the store and we're making adjustments and tweaks and really trying to make sure we perfect 365 before we really hit the gas on new store openings.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies.Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: ...my question. So just really quickly, unfortunately, I hopped on the call a little bit late but if I missed it, Walter or John, can you happen to talk about what type of cost-cutting capabilities remain? You mentioned that you're more than half done as it relates to reaching your goal of $300 million. But I'd just love to hear what opportunities remain or buckets that you could go after? And then in addition, as it relates to the marketing spend in the first half of the year, is there any ability to help kind of provide some additional color or quantify that for us?David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: This is David. Just a couple of things we're \u2013 again pointing back to 365. 365 is the first area of Whole Foods where we're actually doing auto replenishment. So, in other words, our automatic orders, less labor to actually do orders in the store, so we're learning from that process and we've started a few tests of category management in a few different regions, and again early results are good so we think there's a really long runway of cost savings there. And then all the regional presidents are working very hard on combination teams as John said in the script. He talked about meat and seafood, but we're also combining a lot of teams so we're seeing reductions in labor at the store level as we kind of work our way through those combinations.", "404": " It's all baked in the numbers, but we're going to \u2013 what John had said in the script is we're going to go always on this year and others. I think our learnings from the past have been that we've stopped and started. And I think what we realized we need to stay out there and stay out there in multiple places and there will be some burst during the year that you'll see, it'll be more visible than others on TV, but it's a steady state throughout the year and it's already baked into the numbers.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: We think we have the right leadership in marketing at this point and...Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Absolutely.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: ...we're definitely going to \u2013 we're upping our marketing spend. We have confidence that we're going to market in ways that deliver value for our shareholders. So we're really that quite excited about the marketing strategy that we're going to unleash here. We're already beginning to unleash it and you'll see it much stronger as we get into calendar 2017.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Well, Thanksgiving too. Starting on Thanksgiving, yes. (20:13)Operator: The next question is from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.Andrew R. Ruben - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Andrew Ruben on for Vinnie. Following up on the marketing plan, can you talk about the affinity rollout that's still planned for the upcoming year and how that plays into the overall marketing plan?Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yes, this is Jason. As you know, we went live about 14 weeks ago in Dallas with our enhanced affinity rewards program. We're taking some learnings from that already and building it into our plan to roll to all stores next year. We are not providing specific dates on the call today, but our anticipation is we'll take it to all the U.S. stores, as we've stated in the script and we're very excited about the results that we're already seeing with the revised program.", "405": " John, you had previously mentioned on 365 that the sales productivity per square foot was better than the legacy system and maybe even suggested that ROIC could be accretive and EBIT margins could be accretive. Is there any update there now that you have the Bellevue store in place? Are those still things that you believe are happening?John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: We just still think it's really too early to give long-term projections on 365. Our results have been a little bit mixed. Some of the results have then absolutely blown us away and others have been a little bit less than we had hoped for. So we're still incredibly bullish. We've got 19 stores in development and we're evolving the 365 concept. David said we're in a pause right now, so when we open our fourth store, it's going to be kind of 365 2.0 and we're taking the things that have worked better and we're putting more capital into them. Things that haven't worked, we're phasing out and so I think the \u2013 our next store opens in Cedar Park, is that correct? We're opening our next store in Austin. So our home base store. And when do we expect that might open, David?David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: We haven't announced an opening day, but spring.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Spring 2017. So we think we're going to \u2013 we'll have more data at the time, of course, on our three existing stores.David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: A little color I would say though is the labor hours that we projected for all three stores, we are able to operate the stores at those labor hours, and we think as we grow that was not a surprise we were able to do that. So we are seeing \u2013 and then in terms of our development schedule, we are seeing our ability to open these stores at about half the cost to build a Whole Foods Market.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: And this is Walter. I just wanted to reinforce something that was said earlier, which is that, this is an And, not an Or for Whole Foods and part of what has helped us throughout to stay true to the $300 million run rate and improve our results has been the learnings from 365.", "406": " JT and his team have done a fantastic job. So the effects of 365 go well beyond just the three stores that are open so far.David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Punching above the weight class.William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, that's very useful. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.Thomas Hinsdale Palmer - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for taking my question. I was looking to get a bit of clarity around your price investments. The press release makes reference to the deflationary environment, yet you also note that the average price per item was flat year-over-year. Should we interpret this to mean that input costs were down by more than prices? Or given your mix difference, it was the deflation in some categories more than offset by inflation in others?A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. This is A.C. Yes, I would say that overall costs and retails were pretty flat. We did see in costs and early in the quarter we were definitely seeing some deflation. As the quarter went on, it moderated and we actually saw an uptick in certain categories like our farm-raised salmon, which is a very big part of our seafood sales, saw a dramatic increase towards the end of the quarter. And a couple of produce items, specifically avocados, there was a big disruption in Mexico and we started to see an increase there too. So I would say overall it was fairly balanced. And one thing to remember too with us is that our \u2013 when certain commodity products really drop down, it doesn't affect us as much. So for instance, there has been a large decrease in the commodity eggs this year, but those aren't the eggs we sell. Our eggs are all raised under contract to our quality standards by our producers who produce them based on cost to produce. So we're not as affected as much by some of those big commodity swings with the products that we sell. So I'd say overall, things were pretty flat for us in the quarter.Thomas Hinsdale Palmer - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks.Operator: The next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye Risk Management.Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC (Research): Thank you very much.", "407": " And I was just wondering if maybe you could expand into if that's the case, there were some things left on the cutting room floor, how consumers are using your store? And this is a little bit of the question before about the change in transactions versus the basket size, and maybe some of the other learnings that you could emphasize. Thank you.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: I don't understand the question. You want to know what we didn't tell you in the script? You want to know what we cut? (26:39)Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: No. The cleaning crew's already taken all that stuff. But I think I know what you mean. You're trying to understand the gap or the spread between traffic and items and so forth, I think. I mean the big news really is that the baskets stayed \u2013 all the baskets across the quintile stayed strong. So there might be a little bit of an emphasis on value for customers as we're peering into those baskets and looking for common themes. There might be a sense that customers are watching their value purchases. But at the same time, we're also seeing that the drivers around the things that we do really well, the salmon that A.C. referenced earlier. So I think we just need to \u2013 that's kind of where we need to leave it for today. But thanks for the question.Operator: The next question is from David Magee from SunTrust.David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes, hi. Good afternoon, everybody. You mentioned that you weren't interested in chasing or racing to the bottom, so to speak, in promotions and we understand it's been pretty promotional in the last few months. Are you seeing any change in the environment? And was that related to your traffic dip as well during the quarter?A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi. This is A.C. Excuse me. I think your question was did we change our promotions in the quarter? And did that drive \u2013 change our traffic?David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: No, just the fact that you didn't match promotions during the very promotional period in the last few months, was that related to the traffic dip that you saw as well?A.C.", "408": " So when other people might be promoting certain commodity pricing, we're going to continue to maintain our standards and promote our higher quality products. We did in the beginning \u2013 in the summertime, we found \u2013 the last \u2013 and I think this is true for a lot of retailers. The latter part of the summer is a slower period for us, and we found that promotions during that period don't have as much of an impact as they do \u2013 once you get past mid-July, promotions don't have as strong of an impact. So we did a lot of promotions early in the quarter, especially in our perishable areas. And then as we got to later in the quarter, especially going into late July and August, we did a little less promotions, but we've started to pick that back up now. And we're moving into \u2013 as we move into the holiday period, we've got some really (29:43 \u2013 30:00).Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: That's right, turkeys to sell pretty soon.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yes, one thing I would mention, too with our great national global team of purchasing work, we're doing more common promotions. So for the first time right before Thanksgiving, we're doing a direct mail piece that's going out, that's \u2013 we're dropping to 12 million households around our Thanksgiving promotions. This is a common set of promotions across all stores. So first time we've ever done that, so we're really kind of excited about that for Thanksgiving and then doing a similar process for both Christmas and New Year's resolutions.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: I want to just add something. This is Walter. I just think what A.C. said is so important to really land here is that we're going to be price relevant. We've been talking about that for a couple of years about truing up on to the market that's changing and being competitive and we've learned to be more selective and careful and really analytical about where that needs to happen, and I think you're starting to see some of the green shoots from that effort. But what A.C. is also saying is really important.", "409": " Remember what's great about this company and the products that we sell and the environment we create and the team members that we have, and just hammer home effect. That is where we win as a company. That is how we do it. So that's a very important part of the answer to go along with the pricing and price investments.Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yes. Just to add on, this is Jason. We've also put some significant focus in some of our digital marketing and promotions. As we've previously mentioned, we've got about 5 million subscribers in our CRM databases which allow us to push out promotions through email, and we've seen a lot of uptick in that particular space. And we will be doing a number of offers throughout the holiday period there. We're also continuing to add more digital coupons and are seeing a lot of traction in that space. It's really as we called before sort of our affinity light, the sort of precursor to our rewards program, so more offers are going in there. And this really allows us to have the ability to target offers as well as learn better around the behaviors of what's driving folks into stores and making sure that we're teeing up offers that are relevant for our customers.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: One last thing, John here. Going forward, a lot of our price investments we're going to make, we want to tie it very closely to our category management strategy. I think we've made some price investments that weren't as data-driven as they needed to be, and we've learned a lot of lessons from that. And now as we begin to roll out category management, we are going to really tie the future price investments into the overall category management strategy. So I think that's important for people to understand.David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great job. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies.Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Yes, thanks for the follow-up. So, just kind of from a cultural perspective, obviously that's very important to you guys at Whole Foods. So can you just provide some color on how the employees themselves are actually responding to the changes thus far?", "410": " I can talk about the customer insight. One of the things that we're working on is really building a good cadence with our leadership team from our data and customer insight group that we've put together with Sonya joining us and really providing weekly and monthly view of what our customers are telling us, and how they are responding to the changes we are making. And we're also looking at how we evolve that and sort of how we change our decisions around merchandising and coordination of any kind of evolution into the business model. So our process, we're bringing that into our look every week and every period in terms of the similar process when we look at sales comps as well.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yes, and I would say with the team members, you know, a big part of our culture, the environment culture is to really have the team members help us participate in creating that change. So even though there's some tough and challenging adjustments we're making in terms of expense reductions, labor reductions, the inclusionary part with our team members has really helped, and a project that we're rolling out across the whole company right now, our order-to-shelf project is our team members have really got very excited as we revamped our back rooms really focused on reducing out-of-stocks for our customers, that they can see the way forward and a way to win. And we win when our team members are happy, and we're not losing focus on that at all.Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yes, and this is Jason. Some of the things that we do, if you take some of the stuff that's moved to self-service as an example, has some great opportunities around win-win for both the store as well as the customers. So they can have a little bit more ease in selecting and picking up certain items, that ends up being a great win there on both sides.Operator: The next question is from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets.Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about gross margin a little bit. It seems like that they have come in better than your plan. I'm just wondering it sounds like you mentioned some price investments that weren't maybe as informed as they could be.", "411": " Any color on that topic would be helpful.A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Hi, Kelly, A.C. here. As John just mentioned a few minutes ago, we want to be a lot more strategic with our price investments. We realized two things over this past year. One is that our customers really are \u2013 the most important thing for us is to maintaining quality both in our products and our experience. So it's very clear that we're not going to lower our quality in order to get lower pricing. The second thing that we realize is that we do a lot better with our promotional activity than just lowering regular pricing. So we have maintained our \u2013 as I said earlier, we're going to continue to really push our promotional activity. And then the third thing is really tying our price investments to category management. We're absolutely committed to continuing to invest in prices but in a much more strategic way. We found that through category management, especially now that we have the Nielsen Data to use along with it that we can make much more effective price investments if we do it through that strategy.David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: And I would also say \u2013 this is David. Pivoting back to the 365 stores is that streamlining the selection actually gives us a better price image in general. We founded that and we're bringing some of those principles back to Whole Foods as we go through the category management process and streamline our selection. That alone will also help our price image.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Walter. Just adding one more thing here. And if you think about the evolution of the affinity platform it's our ability to really focus the investments against the customer that we actually know who they are and what they want and the return on the investments there are 4x, 5x, what they are to the general population. So it becomes a much more effective use of the dollars that we would invest.Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. That's very helpful and then just one more if I can on Instacart. Can you just give any more color on how that's going? I think you mentioned maybe expanding into some more markets and how that relationship is going.", "412": " I'll comment. We've been continuing to expand our partnership with Instacart. A big part of the year-to-date has been around expanding ZIP Codes in existing markets. We've also gone live in several new markets like Phoenix which is what we went live with last week. We've also announced in our last call about our white label that basically allows customers to go to wholefoodsmarket.com and without leaving the Whole Foods Market digital ecosystem place their orders for delivery and we've seen that as a great win as well. Overall, the partnership is going well. And to your point, we are seeing larger baskets in this particular area. As we continue to use things like affinity, we're going to be able to zero in more to really understand customers that are both shopping physically in the store and using this as an opportunity to have groceries delivered directly to their house. Similar to how we look at 365 in Whole Foods Market with our partnership with Instacart we look at our physical store experience and our delivery as an And, not an Or. Our goal is to make sure that we are at the point where our customer wants to be met and the great part about the relationship with Instacart is it gives us sort of that ability to meet the customer and bring in groceries to their house.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Walter. Just adding one more thing. I think that with Instacart what's great is that if you look at the platform or if you go through wholefoodsmarket.com to get which is powered by Instacart, essentially we have the chance to continue to make that a much richer shopping experience than it is today. I mean it's very good, it works, it's very utilitarian. But if you think about the richness of our stores, the goal is ultimately to have the Instacart experience or the wholefoodsmarket.com experience to be as rich as it is in the store. So we can grow it horizontally as well as vertically and there's just a lot of runway left to go in the relationship with Instacart.Operator: And the last question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my follow-up question.", "413": " So first on competition, as you look at your markets over the next few quarters based on your current visibility, what's your read in terms of competitive encroachment in terms of your markets? Does it improve at all versus what you've seen in recent quarters? And then secondly on cannibalization, how are you thinking about cannibalization this year versus recent quarters?John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: John here. So I'll take the second part of the question first. I mean cannibalization has been a factor at Whole Foods, and one of the things about moderating our rate of growth a little bit will be to lessen the cannibalization impact on our comps. So I mean we continue to open stores that are EVA-positive including cannibalization. But with our comps being negative, we're particularly sensitive right now to not adding to that comp number through additional cannibalization, so we're very conscious of that. And that's being thought through carefully when we do make real estate decisions now. And what \u2013 the first part of the question (41:38)?Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Just on the competition. I know in the I guess last couple of quarters, you've had a number of competitor openings in your markets. Just want to get a sense if that's at all easing as you look forward the next few quarters?John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Yes, well, yes, maybe a little bit but it's a very tough market out there. There's a lot of \u2013 I mean if you think about it, you not only have strong conventional supermarkets like Kroger and H-E-B and Wegmans, but you've also now got more of the discount natural food operators like Sprouts and Fresh Thyme and Lucky's and they're all growing. And then you've got more delivery fresh stuff like Amazon, and then you've got these meal kit operators like Blue Apron and HelloFresh and Plated. And so it's a very competitive market out there. And I like Whole Foods' positioning. I like our positioning frankly better than anybody else's, but I think everybody's feeling it.", "414": " Everybody's feeling that. I'm seeing everybody's comps go down everywhere. And it's just a very competitive environment. Great thing about Whole Foods is we're producing a lot of cash. We're making good investments. We've got a very good long-term positioning as this marketplace plays itself out. And so undoubtedly, the marketplace over time, there'll be more consolidation. There'll be some exits from the market; already seeing some of that. There are people going private or getting out of the public marketplaces. So I like our positioning but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. We've got a competitive runway ahead of us and we got to up our game. And that's what we're intending to do.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: And I just think, Walter here, that the \u2013 again, I think the Q results speak for themselves in terms of the green shoots and that we have \u2013 yes. And you see the signs of progress of the seeds we've been planting for the last couple of years and again what we said in the script, I think we really have made some great decisions together as a group about where we're going to go in 2017, whether it's affinity, whether it's marketing, whether it's the selective price investments, all the things we've discussed today. We have a really good plan for 2017, and we have a pretty high level of confidence; maybe have a little of this, little of that. But I think we have a \u2013 directionally, the trajectory we've set for ourself is very clear. So the encouraging \u2013 even with the competition John spoke about, we're putting up some forward momentum. So...David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: And this is David. We're also a strong competitor and we're opening stores, so they have to compete against us. We opened two great stores today, one in Walnut Creek in Northern California; and a second store in Victoria Island, outside of Vancouver and we're really excited about our new store openings and our plan for 2017 and we're going after it.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Best of luck with your efforts.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Thanks.", "415": " He was always getting criticized. He was always hearing from his generals about what Robert E. Lee was going to do. Robert E. Lee is doing this. What are you going to do about that? And one day Grant said, you know, I'm so sick and tired of hearing what Lee is going to do. Well, Lee needs to worry about what we're going to do. And I think that's how I feel about our competitors. They need to worry about what Whole Foods is going to do.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Is doing.Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.Operator: And I will now turn the call back over to John Mackey for closing comments.John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for listening in today, and please visit Whole Foods Market in our stores and online for the best selection of fresh, healthy holiday meals. And join us in February for our first quarter earnings call. Goodbye, everybody.Walter Robb - Whole Foods Market, Inc.: Thank you.Operator: This concludes today's conference call.", "416": " Executives: Brian Olsavsky - Senior VP & CFO Dave Fildes - IRAnalysts: Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Chase & Co. Ross Sandler - Barclays PLC Mark May - Citigroup Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Kenneth Sena - Wells Fargo SecuritiesOperator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "417": " It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.Mark Mahaney: I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company on noteworthy North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016.", "418": " Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.Douglas Anmuth: Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response with continued geographic expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits, we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa.", "419": " We've got 4,000 plus smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'd be really -- I'd incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.Ross Sandler: Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods.", "420": " That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost error -- excuse me, price decrease last year, but we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.Mark May: Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, previously.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1.", "421": " But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. That's probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.Dave Fildes: This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and future launches, better options for customer that -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.Daniel Salmon: First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just be interested in your thoughts on that.Dave Fildes: Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us.", "422": " We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer.Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Justin Post: I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your international about business.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization.", "423": " So excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon, Amazon Family is there, as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.Brian Nowak: I have two. First one, in the press release, you talked about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business.", "424": " Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base.", "425": " There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues. Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.Youssef Squali: We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become?", "426": " This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in some cases. Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and [indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.Kenneth Sena: Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now?", "427": " And AWS is a key component, as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is -- has driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was?Kenneth Sena: Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things?Dave Fildes: Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space.", "428": " A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter.", "429": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A.", "430": " Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.Justin Post: Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Take the subscription first.Dave Fildes: Yeah. Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the subscription services, we\u2019d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. We\u2019d said we'd anticipated about 300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the 300 million is certainly part of that decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number and we direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. We think it was a, Q4 in particular was a great quarter for customers that retail, there is a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses, the teams here had done a great job, planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers. We had a great Reinvent Conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income.Operator: Thank you.", "431": " Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business? Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter, it's a real step up. Do you just want to talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. The first question is on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India, however, there is much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don\u2019t you talk about the advertising growth?Dave Fildes: Yeah, yeah. I think I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so is expanded sponsor brands, placements, some rolled out new campaign reports, so improved campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with the ad tools and the ad services that we offer and we're continually excited about the opportunity there.Brian Olsavsky: And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. This category also includes AWS sales and marketing and keep that in mind, because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going.", "432": " So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.Doug Anmuth: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on India, just bigger picture, Brian, do the new policies change your view at all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then also just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the US and UK from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays?Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's not all we can say on that topic right now. Dave Fildes: Yeah. And I think Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold ahead in to the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that and that was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.Mark May: Thank you. When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment.", "433": " And then somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from several factors, including more modest hiring and more modest growth in fulfillment center capacity, do you see these factors persisting this year? Thanks.Dave Fildes: Yeah. Thank you. Let me start with that last part, because I think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends regarding our cost structure. Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly, unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled demand were, we\u2019ve combined FBA and retail, remained strong. So we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%. And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and \u201917. So while we'll continue to concurrently drive growth and customer offering and Prime benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously and we will continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance.Operator: Thank you.", "434": " Thank you. A little bit -- to dig a little bit deeper into the CapEx capital lease side of things, you guys have said in the past that generally you work to build in line with your expectations for guidance, so that you are trying not to over build or under build when thinking about your fulfilment in data center capacity. We saw that investment re-accelerate in the fourth quarter, after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. I see total CapEx that was -- grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% in Q3 and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as you say, a bit of investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I am not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that, I would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and the lighter year for adding fixed headcount certainly compared to 2016 and 2017 we'll reveal that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we expect in the first three months.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just -- the first one is to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if we try to back out AWS, it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Sure.", "435": " I would say the positive tailwinds still remain, AWS has strong growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping cost, including the free shipping that we did, but mostly, it was the higher Amazon fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong. We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage. There are a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways to commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.Dave Fildes: Yeah. And just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get back to the accounting side. We did adopt that revenue recognition standard in 2018 as I mentioned. As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So specific to Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to other revenue, so you will see that in the other revenue in total.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.Colin Sebastian: Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK? And then marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including Home Furnishings, health and beauty, curious what the strategy is there, I assume to expand selection, but is it also an indication of an increasing focus on those retail categories? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there. They\u2019ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers.", "436": " So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party. On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4. But last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for that and again Diwali had, took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for that, international growth is pretty flat Q3 to Q4.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.Lloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the advertising side, we hear a lot of positive feedback from customers, but also we hear suggestions of their supply constraints. So, how do you guys see inventory growth versus pricing growth as a driver in that business and are there things you can do to grow inventory? And then secondly, there have been some reports, your Amazon shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets. So wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in this test markets and how you think about expanding your shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the advertising piece first. I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products and I think in all those regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation.", "437": " And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics. Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs. So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One on the media side, has there been any step-up in terms of investments around media content to support your ambition with respect to Prime and the video. It's been a couple of years now since we got an update on rate of spend or how it might impact either historical periods or going forward periods, that would be number one. And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising front, how do you think about the video opportunity, you're moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored products search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting with over the top video or connected TV opportunities [indiscernible] going forward. Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Let me start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video spend today, but we do \u2013 it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of again continued strong adoption and the usage and viewing and hours watched of our -- both our music and our seasoned video and music. And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the [indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during the quarter.Dave Fildes: Yeah.", "438": " So ad supported, so that's available on the IMDB website with your laptop or personal computer on. I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content. So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Just two, so just can you comment, did advertising slow down relative to third quarter. One, you kind of adjusting for 606 and then secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and physical stores and if not any commentary why physical stores was down year-over-year? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks, Jason for your questions. Let me start with the physical stores revenues. So physical stores decreased 3% year-over-year and this is primarily Whole Foods, but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4 star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a period last year when we \u2013 we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you remember of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to link it up with Amazon's and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last year. So we're comping that year-over-year. The second piece is that, the -- as you said, the online orders where people go to the Prime Now app and then order for delivery or pick up at Whole Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores component of revenues. So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year accounting days, true up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores.Dave Fildes: Yeah.", "439": " So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.Dan Salmon: Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, can we just return to your comment earlier about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not a surprise there, but just curious through the holiday season, any particular learnings that you can offer some color on and how you view the balance between using your own proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019? And then just a quick follow-up, obviously the HQ2 news came out during the quarter, what would you highlight as maybe the most important next steps there and maybe some color on the feedback from that process, I would be interested to hear that as well? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So let\u2019s start with HQ2. Of course, in November, we announce we selected New York City and Northern Virginia and between the two cities, we will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. We also announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated to be about 5000 jobs. So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. We\u2019re looking forward to investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on that. On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. So Amazon deliveries are a big part of that.", "440": " What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that a lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost profile of the two. We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics, excuse me, transportation final delivery.Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.Ross Sandler: So the AWS operating margins historically kind of move around a bit. Any color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then I guess going back to the investment catch up theme, it sounds like 2019 will be a little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in North America right now, is that going to continue and most of these investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on in India and any color on the North America operating margin trajectory? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it out. That number will move around, we're very pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course, at any point in time, this business is going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build, especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead of our customers\u2019 minds. And infrastructure, well again, it will balance between quarters a bit. Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior three quarters. That had slight impact on the operating margin, but again year-over-year, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around.", "441": " A replay will be available on our Investor Relations site at least through the end of the quarter.", "442": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, January 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.", "443": " Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Operator: At this time, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.Heath Terry: Great. Thanks. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?Brian Olsavsky: Hi Heath. No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries. So, I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market, and we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak. We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So, I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.Colin Sebastian: Great. Thank you. Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what you're referring to 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis.", "444": " So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed.Justin Post: Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could go high level, what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side? Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year. I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping. On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018 when the margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So, we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers.", "445": " So, there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Just to ask about AWS again. I mean, the investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about again the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So, maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the competitive environment? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So, we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So, we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers. As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers. We just had a great re:Invent conference in December where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps to sign or educate our forward road map. So, it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud, and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly I think in the setting that any -- quarter quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy.", "446": " Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.Stephen Ju: Okay. So thank you. I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can do to reduce friction between logistics payments and some of the other factors there? And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon? Thank you.Dave Fildes: Yes Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those say MSMBs micro-small and medium-sized businesses. We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So, this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. A lot of different facets to those types of investments, won't go into too much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025. So, a lot of -- I think innovation, ideas, investment. That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenants that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region.", "447": " Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter. Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable costs sort of still associated with one-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then, maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one day that you\u2019d call out?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3-- was slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance. And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to zero. It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day. So, I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going. If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new routes. Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency.", "448": " So, we've -- last year we're in the middle of that transition. We still are as we shift inventory to be more local, it will enable local deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times. So, that will continue to become more efficient. We do see -- we will have to scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last two years. And we'll look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and grow and handle more one-day volume. Third area is foregone ship revenue just simply, because we're having free shipment and not charging for it. That unfortunately doesn't leverage, but it -- we do start to lap after a while. So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.Dan Salmon: Thanks for taking the question guys. Brain, just to follow-up on one-day shipping. You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter and that naturally costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of one-day shipping either regionally or certain SKUs is functionally finished. I just want to make sure I understand that properly. And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business. And in particular would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start on the one-day.", "449": " We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional zip codes. But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of one-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan. We started with higher one-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.Dave Fildes: Yeah, Dan. In terms of your question around brands. We're focused on the certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story. So, we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business. On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. Line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is as a subset been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part question on AWS if I can. You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward.", "450": " And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So, we as a practice monitor and review, the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4 -- and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers and also AWS annually. As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding four years. We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years. So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this. I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses. So -- and despite that we give AWS customers and actually because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before. So, we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward. Yes, you're right. It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area.", "451": " It will change quarter-to-quarter. We will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020.Dave Fildes: Yes. This is Dave. Just kind of on the modeling point too on that the $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact effectively, we expect that that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So, it's -- I should say the servers are tech infrastructure assets. So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed.Ron Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I just want to ask a little bit more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and see if there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday shopping season. I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the six less days? And then also you mentioned last quarter, an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan or any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1. The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So, it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate and we believe that was the actual outcome.Dave Fildes: On the international?Brian Olsavsky: On the international segment excuse me yes. The -- sorry the first question was for the holiday season. Yes, we don't see that as a factor actually.", "452": " The way we look at it and the way we believe it works at least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they will spend it between generally the middle of November. It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff. So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me early purchase and late purchases. As far as, the six days that sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know you added Amazon Fresh into Prime kind of removing the previous $14.99 a month component there and putting it into Prime and you talked about the 2,000 U.S. cities and towns with two-hour delivery. Can you just talk about what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this point? And then just how you're thinking about your grocery strategy as you're positioned now? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for your question. So, early results are good. We -- our grocery delivery orders from the combination of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market more than doubled in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this. We wanted to take -- we will see where people's tastes and preferences will take them. We are -- whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Market store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future.Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.Mark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks for including me. Then I'll throw off three quick ones.", "453": " You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned reverse and was up this quarter. So, if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there. Second the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year for the last five years you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially and then you may be delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter. Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business? So, any more color there? And then last one since Sunday is coming up. I know you talked about the AWS customers and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about the 49ers? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Good luck 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck Ken Sachse fan. We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on -- sorry, the -- start with gross margin.Dave Fildes: Yes. So, I don't think there's anything too surprising caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot. We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter of course so that helps on the gross margin side as well. And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So, certainly up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course that's reflective of one-day and overall relative to our expectations. As Brian said with the $1.5 billion we guided to it came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected trends efficiencies.", "454": " But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record. And that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year, because we had the -- if you remember the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of headcount, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to zero, but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019 and it actually was a super-efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint. Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have one-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore. I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.", "455": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.", "456": " Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I realize that you may have questions about the news which we announced today in our press release, but I would like to begin with some comments on Q4 results, and then we can proceed to your questions. First, I\u2019d like to start by thanking the nearly 1.3 million Amazon employees who have risen to the challenge of serving customers around the world during this pandemic. We are proud that more than 500,000 people chose to take new jobs at Amazon in 2020. We are committed to providing all employees with great jobs, including $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S., health insurance, 401(k) matching, leading parental benefits, and upskilling opportunities. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations in stores as well as the customers shopping in our Whole Foods Market and other stores. Our Q4 results include approximately $4 billion in COVID-related operating costs, including additional employee pay during the holidays. We continue to see productivity headwinds from physical separation and training of new employees and of course investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. This Q4 spend brings our total COVID-related costs for the year to more than $11.5 billion. Our teams worked hard in 2020 to ramp up in-house COVID-19 testing capabilities that are incremental to those already available to the general public. More than 700 employees are now being tested every hour, and globally we have built hundreds of COVID-19 testing sites in two labs. We are encouraging essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers, and Whole Food Market stores across the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time. We are also working at the federal and state levels to support the vaccinations of frontline employees and those in the community who are providing essential services throughout the pandemic, including enabling pop up clinics in Washington State and Florida with more on the way. Now some comments on Q4 results.", "457": " This year presented additional challenges for our teams as we work to meet strong customer demand, while simultaneously growing our operations\u2019 footprint and welcoming far more new employees than any prior Q4. We welcomed nearly 175,000 new full and part-time employees in Q4 alone. This compares with 50,000 in Q4 of 2019. We also continue to add buildings in our fulfillment and logistics network with square footage growing about 50% year-over-year in 2020. And unlike in a typical year when new buildings are mostly in place by the end of Q3, this year a significant number of them came online in Q4 as our teams pulled out all the stops to be ready for customer demand, and it turns out we needed that capacity in order to fill the strong customer demand in Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $125.6 billion versus our guidance range of $112 billion to $121 billion. You will remember that we kicked off the holiday season early for customers with Prime Day in October versus its usual timing in Q3. We then saw strong seasonal holiday demand through Q4. Our Q4 results also largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we have seen since the early months of the pandemic, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other home products. We saw sales growth across our major product categories, led by strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. Prime members also continue to expand their usage of Prime\u2019s digital benefits including Prime Video and Prime Video channels. Amazon Music launched podcast in September and in Q4, Prime members listened to millions of hours of podcasts each month. We\u2019re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q4, we had another strong quarter that largely reflects the continuation of demand trends from Q3. We saw strong growth in new Prime member sign-ups. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the additional volume leverage helped to achieve higher-than-expected profits. We saw strong order volumes throughout the holiday season with good sales growth not only in our peak sales days, which include Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, but also throughout the remainder of the quarter. We had good operational performance within our fulfillment centers and transportation network even as we added significant capacity. Third-party sellers also stepped up as never before to serve customers.", "458": " Third-party units represented 55% of total paid units during the quarter, the highest 3P unit mix we\u2019ve ever had since we invited businesses to sell on Amazon more than 20 years ago. Lastly, AWS\u2019 efforts were headlined by our Ninth Annual re:Invent Conference. This is the first time in our history that the event was virtual and free. We had over 570,000 registered attendees during the three-weeks-long event. AWS continues to innovate at a rapid clip, announcing more than 180 new services and features at re:Invent across compute, storage, database, machine learning, and more. You can read more about this in our earnings release. The team also announced significant customer momentum with new commitments and migrations from JPMorgan Chase, Thomson Reuters, ViacomCBS, and Twitter just to name a few. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. In Q4, AWS saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth. AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in any quarter in its history and is now a $51 billion annualized run-rate business supporting millions of active AWS customers. And just as they have all year, sellers, partners, and employees across Amazon stepped up to deliver on unprecedented customer demand, and for this we remain extremely grateful. And today, we announced that our Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter this year and that Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. Those of us who know Andy are excited to see him take on this greater responsibility. He is a visionary leader, a great operator, and he understands what makes Amazon such a special innovative company. We are also excited that Jeff will retain a very important role at the company that he founded and has guided for over 25 years. He has created a culture of invention and innovation that drives us every day, and we remain bound by our common focus and obsession on the customer. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Heath Terry: Great. Thanks.", "459": " And then just on the AWS business, bit more of a housekeeping question, would you mind going through just where the backlog stands and any material drivers of changes in the that to the extent there has been any?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you, Heath. I would start on international segment results. So yes, it was sequential growth jump from 33% in Q3 to 50% in Q4. Part of that is the timing of Prime Day, but in the U.S. it was less pronounced, sequential growth was 39% to 40% in the North America segment. So, there was something else going on in international in Q4. I would attribute it really to the government actions and lockdowns that we saw, especially in the UK and Europe. I think that increased during the quarter unfortunately for the economy, but it did drive higher sales on our site. We also saw probably a larger impact of moving Prime Day from Q3 to Q4 in international just because it\u2019s a little more nascent there, it\u2019s still ramping up but very strong performance.Dave Fildes: Yes, Heath, this is Dave. On the backlog number, it\u2019s at about $50 billion at the end of the year, the balance and that\u2019s up about 68% year-over-year. So that\u2019s one component of all the great work that AWS is doing, and of course you are seeing some continued very strong growth, strong usage and revenue growth there, $51 billion annualized run-rate business. So, it\u2019s continuing to grow at a meaningfully larger absolute dollar rate than others out there, and we are really pleased with the growth we are seeing in there. It\u2019s as Brian touched on at the opening, just a lot of good engagement and innovation coming out of the re:Invent conference as well.Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Just following up on some of the comments you made between the release and in your opening comments, Brian, wanted to know if we could tease out how we should be thinking about the level of investments that are needed between the mix of fulfillment versus where you want to go on the customer service side and the logistics and delivery side as you look up to \u201821.", "460": " And there will be sort of tougher comp dynamics as you get into the middle of \u201821 as you are lapping against that demand impact in \u201821? How do we think about the levels of investment you will make, where those investments are going to go, and what that means for sort of confidence on the demand side over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Eric. Obviously, we had a large investment last year, crew fulfillment capacity, including transportation 50% year-over-year. I would say that \u2013 and it\u2019s been, I believe it\u2019s $44 billion on CapEx, yes. We are still working through our plans for 2021. I think the added complexity here is the range of outcomes certainly was the case in 2020, but even for 2021, there is a lot of question as to the continuation of COVID conditions comping against prior year sales, sometimes there are things in there that definitely wouldn\u2019t repeat probably the number of gloves we sold and hand lights [ph] and things like that or computer monitors that people setup their home offices. But there is also a lot of people who engage more strongly with Prime benefits in 2020, and we think that will have a lasting impact both from purchase frequency, amount they purchased, use of digital benefits, etcetera. So, we are going to have to build probably for multiple scenarios, and in this FC [ph] world, it\u2019s hard to turn that capacity on quickly. So, it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience. On transportation, we made large investments in our transportation network in 2020. That work is not done yet. We have a lot of continued expansion. So, we see that over definitely through 2021. I can\u2019t quantify it right now only \u2013 I am only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working some -- through some of the plans as we do this time of the year. And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We are supporting an AWS business that is growing at a rapid clip both in usage and in revenue. We are expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area talking with customers on their transition plans to the cloud. So, we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that.", "461": " Please proceed with your question. Doug, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.Doug Anmuth: Sorry, I was muted. Brian, hoping you could talk more about the importance of AMZL Amazon Logistics during the holiday season. If you could talk more about percentage of packages perhaps shipped from your fulfillment centers and then where this can go in coming years? And then also a quick comment on the COVID costs, you mentioned $2 billion in 1Q, just curious how you think about it more on a full year basis with some of the puts and takes can be there? Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. So yes, for the full year, we are again $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4. We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1 that compares with a $600 million spend last Q1 as the pandemic just started and we started to react in March. And obviously, this cost escalated in Q2 and Q3. So, if we look at the core components of that, right, there is productivity that \u2013 productivity drags from hiring so many new employees and also having physical separation. That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4, because of all the new hires that we brought on over 170,000 new people that should moderate. That\u2019s why one of the reasons that we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4, it\u2019s volume-related and also mix of employees. After that, we are going to have to see again hopefully the vaccine gets going, everyone gets vaccinated and we return to normalcy. That would be very helpful on a lot fronts for everybody. And if not there will be continuation of some of these costs. I will say that, while we are very transparent or try to be on the costs that we are seeing, specifically around COVID, there are some positive things happening as that counteract a bit of that and not the least of which is the top line volume in 2020, we grew 37% on an FX neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019. And the fact that we have been running pretty full out since arguably April, but definitely it\u2019s May, has created operating efficiencies of its own that counterbalance the physical separation and the training of new employees. So there is a lot of moving parts in here.", "462": " We will see how that develops over time. Marketing, although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4 definitely was lower in Q2 as we work through some capacity issues and it wasn\u2019t fruitful to invest in marketing when you are having trouble hitting existing customer demand. So, there are a lot of moving parts that I will try and be as transparent on as I can be during the quarter and this again Q1 is we are seeing about $2 billion of absolute COVID costs. And Dave can take the AMZL question.Dave Fildes: Yes. Just as we talk about AMZL, Amazon Logistics, right, that\u2019s where you think about that in terms of facilities, it\u2019s a lot of the middle mile and the last mile elements that are under our management and control. And so you are talking about centers at the middle mile delivery station to the last mile. We have talked on a square footage basis 2020 was a big build year for us. Our footprint grew around 50%, about half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMZL transportation side of the equation, which is a higher mix than what you have seen of any incremental adds in a year. It\u2019s higher mix being 50:50 than what you see from us in the past. So, a lot of focus on that there both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the one day delivery capabilities for Prime members. That also as we have moved through this year, it gives us a little bit more or much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to point B. So we finished here where now more than half our packages, both U.S. and worldwide are handled through AMZL and a lot of work going into that. And so, we will look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMZL offerings. But as we have said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there, the USPS is certainly oversees carriers as well, are an important part of that and they will continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better.Operator: Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.John Blackledge: Great. Thank you. Two questions.", "463": " And then secondly on grocery was a big driver for Amazon in 2020 just general thoughts on grocery and I think you mentioned in the release, 7 communities rolled out Amazon Fresh grocery stores, how are they performing and should we expect a broader rollout?Brian Olsavsky: Sure, John. Let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q3 and 41% in Q2 that is primarily advertising. That\u2019s the majority of it. I would say that there has been a recovery, in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact here, because again it carries a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for this time period. But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers, vendors, authors, publishers and partners use our tools, navigate them as fluidly as possible, and add value both for them and for our customers \u2013 and customers and get to see and find and discover new and different products. There is some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We are now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that. We are improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time. And we have seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsored brands. All these things help checkup the conversion and the productivity of the advertising both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon and makes it more productive experience with the customer as well.Dave Fildes: John, on the grocery point, yes, we have got a couple of different formats, I think there is the Go Grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start, lot of interest in those and the technology that those offer as well as the Amazon Fresh locations. So we are at about 8 locations open and I think in the neighborhood of about half dozen locations are confirmed at open, so more to come on those. There is other kind of tangents of footprints on that, the Go stores, there is around 25 of those that are out there and that also important part of that is food.", "464": " I think they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not wanting to have physical contact with everyone in the store, but just even beyond that, the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment, so excited to do more on that front.Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I would be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020 and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in \u201821 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you\u2019ve gained throughout 2020? And the second one understanding the comments, Brian, earlier about sort of investments going forward, maybe just talk to us a little bit about one-day. Are these investments you are making, could they get you back to a one-day product in later part this year or in \u201822 when the world normalizes or are these assets you are putting in place now not able to be deployed from a one day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit?Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us and it\u2019s kind of what we saw. There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going in time \u2013 rate for 2020. Now again, that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce, keeping our workforce safe and everything else, but I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame some of the more fixed costs that we\u2019re seeing in the Prime benefits. So we pre-invested, as we have discussed in the past, in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering, now grocery, you\u2019re starting to see. And we have added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America.", "465": " So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in the international segment. But you\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes and with it, higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over-time. And we\u2019ll see the growth rate is going to have the same challenges year-over-year that perhaps we\u2019ll see in North America we\u2019re going to have a race between lapping things that may have been one-time in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members\u2019 purchases, purchase frequency and adoption of digital benefits. So we will see what that looks like in 2021, very happy with the performance in 2020 and really hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America.Dave Fildes: And I know this is a bit of an offshoot, but I just think it\u2019s worth mentioning it fits in the AWS business, but we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth from AWS around the world as well. And there is a number of international located customers out there like MercadoLibre and Zalando and others that we\u2019ve listed in there that are great customers for us. So we\u2019re working on that and really looking to support that just globally. And I mentioned this before, but re:Invent, it was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free. And typically, we\u2019ve recorded the revenue for re:Invent from ticket sales and sponsorships. If you account for this COVID anomaly this year of it being virtual and free, AWS year-over-year revenue growth, if you look at it, actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So a lot of fun innovation, good innovation coming out of that event that we\u2019re excited to talk more with customers about.Brian Olsavsky: And then your question on one-day, I believe it was whether our investments will be consistent with establishing higher and higher levels of one-day. Yes, definitely. And we\u2019ve been doing that throughout the year and it\u2019s been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24 in the United States for holiday gifts.", "466": " So it wasn\u2019t that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself, it was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle backlog of demand. So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better. I\u2019m not quantifying this for you. I realize that. But I think you can generally notice wherever you\u2019re particularly are, whatever geography you are, some cities are back probably to one-day levels that they saw or even better pre-pandemic. Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlogs and volume issues. But when the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you\u2019ll see greater and greater one-day percentages for our Prime shipments.Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Justin Post: Alright, thank you. A couple. First, obviously, the Jeff Bezos announcement is quite important. I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that? And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that. And then secondly, obviously, the backlog is really strong in AWS, up 68%. The margins did come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter to 28%. Can you talk about the deals, how pricing is in the cloud segment? Is it remaining robust and any reason the margins came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Justin. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the Consumer CEO transition. I think they\u2019re both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The Board of Directors obviously takes that very seriously. It is an annual discussion and probably more often on succession plans, development of key executives, expanding the number of key executives, etcetera. And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the S team as we, 5 years ago, set up the two-CEO structure where Jeff Wilke was CEO of Consumer and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS. We have strong single-thread leaders on devices, Amazon or \u2013 Video, including Amazon Studios, Advertising.", "467": " So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke, Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interest that he has outside of Amazon. He had been here over 20 years, had been super pivotal in our development of our consumer business, our culture, the development of layers and layers of leaders. And one of them was Dave Clark, who has, over the last 5 plus years, really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our Company, the expansion of the fulfillment center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery and the grocery plan, a lot of other things. But Dave had been great leader in his own right. So when Dave \u2013 or, excuse me, when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall, it was a natural transition to Dave Clark. And that just occurred in January, and they\u2019re wrapping things up in the next month. So that\u2019s a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. Same thing for Jeff Bezos\u2019 role and I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving. He is getting a new job. He\u2019s going to be Executive Chair of the Board, super important role. The Board is super active and important in Amazon\u2019s success story. And Andy has been here since 1997. He is not only a visionary leader. He is a strong operator as I said and he has got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon, not the least of which is AWS, which is arguably the most profitable, important technology company in the world. So that\u2019s just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We\u2019re very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get new perspectives. So Andy has a chance to put his imprint on Amazon. He is certainly going to carry through the culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is and will take that to the next level. Jeff will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. He will be involved in many large one-way-door issues, as we say, one-way doors, meaning the more important decisions, things like acquisitions, things like strategies and going into grocery and other things.", "468": " We will be working on backfilling the AWS role and we will talk more about that in the future, but for now, today is about Andy and Jeff Bezos.Dave Fildes: And Justin, just on your AWS point, I mean, like I\u2019ve mentioned before, AWS growth rate is strong. The factors we\u2019ve talked about in the past continue to be in play. We\u2019re improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs, given the growth we\u2019re seeing. More broadly, our results reflect that balance between the investing, the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies and the margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in new regions and some other elements. A few discrete things that aren\u2019t probably new but just to call out, the driver of the reduced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers. As you recall, we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from 3 to 4 years, and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total. When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So when we increased it beginning in January, the benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million. That\u2019s down from $634 million in Q3. So that gives you some sense of it\u2019s coming down. That\u2019s the total amount that\u2019s allocated amongst the segments, but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because significance of the server assets going to that segment. And again, that impact\u2019s going to continue to taper down over time for example into Q1 of 2021. One other element is just FX impact. That\u2019s always going to hit us to some degree, but AWS customer billings are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. The cost, though, if you think about it, many of the costs are going to be for build-out in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you, so there\u2019s a bit of a foreign exchange difference there. And that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger. We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the AWS margin this time around for FX, so just another point to call out there. You mentioned the backlog, too.", "469": " You saw a long list of the many companies that we have announced arrangements within the past 90 days, so really excited to continue to build onto that.Operator: Our final question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Ross Sandler: Hey, guys. Yes, just going back to the topic of shipping cost inflation. This is one of the few lines that\u2019s kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs. And Dave, you mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon Logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts? And if you look at the cost curve in places like the UK where \u2013 or in London, where you have well over half on your own last-mile delivery, are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that? And thanks a lot.Dave Fildes: Yes. On that \u2013 this is Dave. I think it\u2019s not \u2013 I won\u2019t give a forward kind of guidance mix or what that levels-off like. Some of the step-up in costs and disparity or the bigger gap, I should say, versus the unit growth rates that you\u2019re seeing there, there\u2019s a few factors. But I think this is Q4. We did add on a lot of new capacity as I said. It came on later in the year into Q4. More of it was in kind of that transportation arm and so the costs associated with that would be going to that trans cost piece. So that\u2019s one of the factors, along with the fact that we\u2019re continuing to try where we can to focus on improving one-day. And that varies region to region with all the kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year. But that\u2019s a goal of ours, is to get back to where we were in terms of one-day unit mix and continue to build onto that. So that\u2019ll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021.Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months.", "470": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2021 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, February 3, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC.", "471": " It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by once again acknowledging and thanking our employees around the world for their efforts. This was the second holiday season during this pandemic, and it required exceptional collaboration and coordination among our employees and business partners to prioritize both safety and customer experience. The team did a great job of delivering for customers this holiday. Now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter financial results. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $137.4 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to focus on offering the best experience for our customers across our businesses. On the consumer side, we welcomed millions of new Prime members in both the United States and international during the quarter, while continuing to see consistently high member renewal rates across geographies. Our third-party sellers, in particular, benefited from strong customer demand this holiday season. 3P sellers provided 56% of all unit sales in the quarter, the highest fourth quarter mix ever. And AWS saw a continuation of the strong usage and revenue growth we\u2019ve seen throughout 2021. AWS added more revenue year-over-year than any quarter in its history, and it\u2019s now a $71 billion annualized run rate business, up from $51 billion run rate one year ago. Even on a large base, revenue increased 40% year-over-year. As I\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls, we also encourage you to look at the multiyear compounded annual revenue growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this revenue growth in perspective. Despite lapping 2020\u2019s extraordinary sales growth, we continue to see an increase in customer demand and sales during the remainder of 2021, even as the economy opened back up. For Q4, Amazon\u2019s two-year annual compounded growth rate was 25%, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, consistent with our rate in the third quarter. We\u2019ve invested significantly to keep pace with this demand, including nearly doubling our operations capacity in the past two years, expanding our fulfillment center footprint while adding significant transportation assets to ensure fast on-time delivery.", "472": " Our fourth quarter operating income was $3.5 billion. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we did see more than $4 billion in costs from inflationary pressures and loss productivity and disruption in our operations. The inflation primarily relates to wage increases and incentives in our operations as well as higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting our fulfillment network. Loss productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak. This is driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021 and more recently by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter. Our results also include approximately $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021 and that fulfillment network was running at close to 100% capacity during this time. Now with more normal fulfillment capacity, our operating leverage decreases versus the comparable prior year periods. We expect to continue to see some negative year-over-year impact from this in Q1 of 2022. While we navigate these near-term headwinds, the fundamentals of our retail business are strong and we are optimistic about a number of growth businesses and a strong innovation pipeline. AWS delivered another strong quarter of growth as enterprises and developers continue to look to AWS for critical innovative cloud solutions. Now to $71 billion annualized revenue run rate, AWS revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q4, our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate acceleration. We hosted our 10th re:Invent conference in the quarter, welcoming 26,000 in-person attendees and hundreds of thousands who attended virtually. re:Invent remains a highlight of the year for us because it\u2019s a great opportunity to introduce new services while engaging with customers and partners to better inform where we should be focusing next. We announced more than 115 new services and features during the event as businesses spanning all major industries continue to choose AWS as their technology provider to speed up innovation in their organizations. In the past quarter alone, NASDAQ announced a multiyear partnership to migrate North America markets to AWS, including their matching engine. Best Buy selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services.", "473": " And Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram selected AWS as its preferred global cloud provider for vehicle platforms to accelerate new digital products and upskill global workforce. You can find more examples in our earnings release of how the world\u2019s largest companies such as Adidas, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Rivian and more are using AWS to transform their businesses. Overall net income was $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While we normally focus our comments on operating income, I\u2019d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $11.8 billion related to our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, which completed its initial public offering in November. Before we move to Q&A, there are three additional items I\u2019ll mention related to our disclosures. First, we are now separating advertising services revenue from other revenue as part of our revenue disclosures by groups of similar products and services. This updated presentation is provided in the supplemental financial information included in our earnings release. We\u2019re excited to continue innovating in areas like sponsored ads, streaming video and measurement. Of course, advertising only works so we make it useful for Amazon customers when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. Second, we\u2019re prospectively updating the useful life of our servers and networking equipment, beginning in January. As a practice, we monitor and review the useful lives of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. We are increasing the useful life for servers from four years to five years and network equipment from five years to six years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense. We expect the quarterly impact of this change to decrease throughout the year. Although we\u2019re calling out an accounting change here, this really reflects a tremendous team effort by AWS to make our server and network equipment last longer. We\u2019ve been operating at scale for over 15 years, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. This then lowers stress on the hardware and extends the useful life, both for the assets that we use to support AWS\u2019 external customers as well as those used to support our own internal Amazon businesses. And finally, we will increase the price of Prime in the United States in Q1.", "474": " In recent years, we\u2019ve added more product selection available with fast free unlimited shipping, more exclusive deals and discounts, and more high-quality entertainment, including TV, movies, music and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals. And this September, Prime Video will also release the highly anticipated the Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of an historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League. Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of same-day delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90. Items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%. And members have saved billions of dollars shopping on Prime days. It\u2019s all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music catalog for Prime members as well as Prime Reading and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits, and the increased member usage that we\u2019ve seen as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the United States with the monthly price going from $12.99 to $14.99 and the annual membership going from $119 to $139. This is our first price increase since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18th. For current Prime members, the new price will apply after March 25th on the date of their next renewal. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the comments in the release by Andy on same-day delivery. Can you talk a little bit about how many of those investments might be behind you versus ahead of you with respect to same-day delivery and how that sets the Company up with respect to either consumption behavior by consumers versus the competitive dynamic you\u2019re seeing against elements of like omnichannel and last-mile delivery competitors? Thanks so much.Brian Olsavsky: Hi Eric, sure thing.", "475": " We feel good about where we are. We\u2019re continuing to build capacity that enables us to hit those cutoffs. I think his comments were more around getting us back to our pre-pandemic levels for one-day delivery and improving upon that and then getting same-day to more and more metropolitan areas. We\u2019re doing that globally as well, but we really think that that combination of speed for different product levels -- or product line, excuse me, really resonates with customers. And there\u2019s a lot of new offers for free -- or excuse me, generally free shipping on a fast basis. But we know how hard this is. And our goal is to do it and do it at a price that we can make money on as well and our cost structure commensurate with that. So, that\u2019s where the difficult work comes in, but we like the progress we\u2019ve made developing our Amazon Logistics capability over the last few years. And what we\u2019ve been adding, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve doubled the capacity in the network over the last two years. That is not all just to handle today\u2019s volume. It\u2019s also to handle getting closer to the customer and being able to ship faster. So, we like where we stand. We know there\u2019s work to do on improving our customer service. We like the progress we\u2019ve been making lately, but we think the future is bright on that dimension.Operator: Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Brian, the first one, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s changed within the retail business, sort of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic more same-day, more grocery, more last-mile investments in an ad business. Curious to hear, as you sort of -- you think about the long-term profitability of the retail segment, has your view about how you think about long-term profitability or cash flow retail fallen at all post-pandemic because of the higher required investments is the first one?", "476": " Thanks.Brian Olsavsky: Sure. On the second one, we have a history of making long-term bets for customers, and some of those fall into very small short-term revenue businesses. They\u2019ll generally roll up into other revenue, which you see as very small after we\u2019ve separated out advertising. So, I think that you do see it in our revenue disclosure generally. But a lot of our profitability is shown at the segment level, and we\u2019ll continue to do that with the revenue disclosure. You asked about the business model. I think it\u2019s a good question. And we are -- as we reflect over the last two years, we are encouraged by a lot of things. You ticked them off there, the adoption of digital benefits, the use of grocery and how valuable that\u2019s become to customers, not to mention the acceleration of companies going to the cloud. The ability to double our fulfillment capacity over that time period, including making major strides in our Amazon Logistics sets us up well for the future. And -- but we\u2019ve been also dealing with a lot of disruption during this time period. So, the early wave of disruption was handling volume without the capacity to handle it, and then, quickly playing catch-up. And as that was starting to improve, labor took a turn in the United States, especially labor availability, and we\u2019ve really had scrambled to add workers. We\u2019ve been successful at it. We added over 273,000 employees in the last half of last year. But I think if you look at the prior year, it was over 400,000. So, there\u2019s a lot of expansion that\u2019s been going on in the network. And we feel good about the basic contributors of profitability. There\u2019s -- if you step back, there\u2019s procurement margin and working with vendors and sellers as well. There\u2019s fees in some cases, for 3P services and Prime, as we just mentioned is going up. Advertising has certainly added a layer of contribution over the last few years. But again, that only works and is only successful if we make it a good customer experience. So, we\u2019re really working hard to do that. And that becomes a part of our ability to offer lower prices, better selection and more convenience. So, if you take those, those are all stable and strengthening areas.", "477": " We have, again, built a lot of capacity. We\u2019ve hired a lot of people. Some of those people are still -- our teams are all battling Omicron right now. But, we do see the sun coming out and getting better here over the next number of quarters, and that\u2019s going to be where we\u2019re going to put a lot of our effort.Operator: Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you doubled your fulfillment network and also your headcount over the past two years. I believe you\u2019re about 2.5 years into this investment cycle. Where is Amazon in terms of emerging from this investment cycle? Can you see a slowdown in that big investment spending this year?Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about capital expenditures. And I\u2019m going to do this with the inclusion of equipment finance leases, which is the residual that we sometimes lease on our infrastructure assets. We\u2019re doing less of it now, but we still do some and have done it historically. So, when you look at those numbers and how they\u2019ve grown over the last few years, I\u2019ll give you the proportions, which I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve initially shown before is about 40% -- just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it\u2019s feeding AWS, but also certainly, Amazon is a large customer of that as well as we build and structure for ourselves directly or through AWS. About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building out our AMZL network, principally globally. The remaining 5% or so is small things like offices and stores and other capital areas. But those are the three main areas. If I look to the future, we\u2019re still working through some of our plans 2022, but it\u2019s coming into focus a bit. We see the CapEx for infrastructure going up. We still have a very fast-growing business this growing globally, and we\u2019re adding regions and capacity to handle usage that still exceeds revenue growth in that business. So, we feel good about making those investments. On the fulfillment center side, that\u2019s about 30% of the spend in the last two years.", "478": " I think there\u2019s always things that can tick up that growth rate, things like expansion of our FBA business, expansion of cube that maybe not be different than the square footage. So, there\u2019s -- we want to have capacity to have a healthy retail and FBA business because that fuels prime in 1-day delivery and 2-day delivery and same-day delivery. So, that\u2019s very important. But we see the FC piece likely moderating this year. And then the third piece is transportation. We still see additional levels of investment in that in 2022. So, if you wrap that up, we expect CapEx including equipment finance leases to increase year-over-year. I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but hopefully, it gives you a little more dynamic on what -- how we approach it.Operator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.Mark Mahaney: You lay out all of these costs that you were expecting to see in the December quarter. Just talk to whether there are any real surprises to you. So, it looks like you had a little bit greater leverage than you may have thought. And then use that to help us think about what the -- I think you said the sun is coming out. Financially, does that mean that we\u2019re going to have a kind of nice improvement in operating margins as we go through the year as some of those temporary costs get temporized and you get to absorb some of the more fixed costs? So, just talk about where the surprise was in terms of those costs that you laid out for the December quarter, the $6 billion? And how should we think about those playing out as we go forward?Brian Olsavsky: Okay, Mark. Just remember that I\u2019m sitting in Seattle. So, my view of the sun coming out is a little different than perhaps where you are. But we do see things improving. We do -- let\u2019s step back to Q4. We had said that we would have about $4 billion of additional costs due to labor shortages and the inefficiencies of that cause as well as increased labor rates and shift differentials of premiums and external transportation costs. We came in just slightly over that $4 billion. I think things went as expected. I would say that the hiring was strong, but we could have done better.", "479": " There are some higher costs on third-party transportation. But, all-in-all, the challenge in Q4 was to staff, raise -- or excuse me, increase the staffing, and we said we wanted to add 150,000 people or more. We added net-net of about 140,000 in the quarter, 273,000 in the second half of the year. So, as you turn the page into 2022, we feel good -- better about labor, except Omicron has kicked up, and now you have a different type of labor issue where there\u2019s a lot of people who are on leave of absences and short term as they work to have a positive test on COVID and can get back into the workforce and protect their fellow workers. So, there\u2019s instances where you\u2019re paying twice or 3 times for the same labor hour if someone is on leave, you\u2019re paying them and you\u2019re also paying potentially for someone who\u2019s covering the shift on over time. So, there\u2019s cost pressure in Q1. I think, the good news is that the labor challenge is not as great in Q1 as it is in Q4 -- Q3 and Q4. So, we\u2019re hopeful on that. We have to work to now make our operations more efficient as we get staffing levels up. And we\u2019re going to plow a lot of our effort into increasing our transportation speeds and beating our pre-pandemic levels. So, there\u2019s a lot of different challenges going on right now. The team has been working heads down for over two years now. So, they need -- we\u2019ve got a great team, and we have confidence that we will -- things will improve as we get through the year. So hopefully, that answers your question.Operator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird.Colin Sebastian: I wanted to ask about AWS, and nice acceleration in revenues there. Wondering if you could talk about maybe more specifically the driver of that acceleration. Is the application layer maybe now large enough where you\u2019re seeing that contribute incrementally to growth? And I think in the release, you also highlighted infrastructure expansion globally. I think it might be interesting to add some context around the scale or distribution of the AWS business internationally outside of North America, if you could put some context around that. Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Colin.", "480": " On the growth rate, I think it\u2019s a combination of things. We\u2019ve been adding resources in sales and marketing over the last few years, and that is starting to pay off. There was some cutback in spending in the early parts of 2020 that we\u2019re lapping as people -- different companies have different COVID experience, some their volumes went through the roof, some their volumes went through the floor. So as things have stabilized, I think the lasting thing is that a lot of people made the commitment to go to the cloud, better understood the benefits of that and probably accelerated their internal time lines for that. And we\u2019re there to help, and we\u2019re working very hard to make that journey a successful one and we have a strong team of sales and marketing professionals to help as well as technical advisors. So that is what we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019re pleased with the acceleration in the business the last four quarters. We will see -- we\u2019re also pleased with the efficiency of the infrastructure investment, as I mentioned, the expansion of useful life is not done on an accounting basis unless you have proof that it\u2019s actually -- we\u2019re seeing it in real life. So, very positive indicators in AWS.Dave Fildes: Colin, it\u2019s Dave here. Just following up on the international point, what we\u2019re seeing outside of the U.S., I mean we are -- as part of that overall strong growth, we are continuing to see considerable momentum really around the world. It\u2019s customers moving their workloads over to AWS at different phases. And so, as you look at the release, some of the other announcements, there\u2019s a good diverse list of companies, Adidas in Germany migrated its SAP environments to AWS, in the Netherlands, Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. There\u2019s a number of really great companies examples doing different big things at different stages of that migration. What\u2019s been important to us, amongst many things is continuing to expand our global infrastructure footprint really to support this momentum we\u2019re seeing. So, just this last quarter in the fourth quarter, we opened the Asia Pacific region over in Jakarta. And we\u2019ve got announcements for plans to launch and Canada in the Calgary region next year or perhaps it 2023 or 2024. So, a lot of work and a lot of momentum. Those are just a few examples.", "481": " And just in terms of the forward-looking road map, we have announced to launch 24 more zones in 8 more regions, and those will be here in the next couple of years.Operator: Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.Jason Helfstein: Thanks. So, I just want to dig a little bit into third-party seller services. The growth slowed there even on a two-year stack. So maybe if you could talk about some of the factors that you think could be weighing on that? And then, just on AWS, you kind of laid out some color there. Is there any bottlenecks to growth that you\u2019re still seeing? I mean, you talked about why this is a very good quarter and having to do with some of the comps, but any bottlenecks to grow, either supply chain or employee related? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Sorry. Jason, is your second question on AWS?Jason Helfstein: Yes, on AWS.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sorry. Let me start with that. No, we don\u2019t see bottlenecks on the capacity side or -- probably the limiter in that business is our ability to work with customers to accelerate their time lines. So, we\u2019re investing and working hard to do that. So -- but operationally, we continue to add capacity, as I mentioned, on the capital section -- capital discussion, and we expect that to increase year-over-year in 2022. On 3P, I think what you\u2019re seeing is a decreasing growth rate, much like the rest of the business, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re dealing with the very high growth period from Q3 of 2020 through Q1 of 2021. But on a two-year basis, you\u2019re still seeing 31% compounded annual growth in the 3P seller services revenue. Granted that was in the -- it was 34% last quarter, but it\u2019s maintaining. I think the bigger point is that sellers are definitely big winners in Q4. The percentage of units up to 56% was a record for 3P. We continue to invest a lot to make sellers -- help sellers be successful on our site. They\u2019re a big consumer of advertising as well because they use it to build their brands and add -- enable customers to see their selection and make purchases.", "482": " Maybe I\u2019ll talk about advertising services. What -- maybe tell us why you decided to break it out, if you haven\u2019t already? And then, how much Prime Day might have been a factor in the deceleration? But bigger picture, how much room does that line have to grow bigger than GMV growth? How do we think about where you are on penetration on that? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with why we broke it out. We\u2019ve looked at the proportion of other revenue that is advertising services. And we got to a point where -- and I had been pretty much mentioning every quarter that for the majority of that line item was advertising revenue. And we feel it at a certain size that we should break it out and split the other half of that. So, that was really the impetus for the change. And we look at those things every year, and end of year was a good time to do it as we start 2022. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful for you to understand the growth rate without having to impute it from the other revenue. The growth rate in the quarter of 33% was down from 66% in Q4 of last year. Q4 last year obviously had Prime Day in it for first time. And Prime Day carries a lot. I can\u2019t scale it for you, but there\u2019s a lot of advertising tied to Prime Day, obviously. So when that moves quarters, it generally has an impact on the run rates. We saw that a bit in Q2 of this year when we did have Prime Day and it was lapping -- Q2 2021 was lapping, the 2020 period that didn\u2019t have a Prime Day in it. So, that will move around a bit. But I think the bigger story here is the success we\u2019re having with sellers and vendors, and making that a useful product for customers.Dave Fildes: And Justin, just to add to that, I mean the priorities with advertising are -- at a high level, it\u2019s improved the tool usability. We think there\u2019s great feedback loops with customers, as Brian mentioned, to keep building and making that better. That results in building more relevancy and better engaging experiences.", "483": " So, really focused on serving brands. And it\u2019s in the sponsored ad space, but we\u2019ve talked about video advertising is certainly a great opportunity. And as we\u2019ve got properties like Fire TV, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports, a lot of exciting things that have been going on in the live sports and certainly to come this year as well, both in the NFL here in the U.S., but overseas in a number of properties, really excited to kind of work with folks. And again, this is about delivering good recommendations to customers and helpful when they\u2019re making their purchase decisions and giving them information around that. And that, in turn, of course, helps the advertisers as well and have a great result. So, I think that\u2019s one area that we\u2019re excited about. Longer term, demand-side platform opportunities with Amazon DSP is something that we\u2019re continuing to work on and refine and again, focus on the customer as we always do.Operator: Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen.John Blackledge: Two questions. First, could you discuss how supply -- the supply chain affected the business in 4Q, and how we should think about perhaps impacts from supply chain issues in 1Q \u201822 and for the year? And then, the second question would be, do you expect to increase Prime pricing in non-U.S. markets? Thank you.Brian Olsavsky: Hi, John. Thank you for your question. First on the Prime question. We evaluate each country differently. We look at the relative price to the customer versus our cost to supply that and the usage and the value that we\u2019re creating for customers. We felt, especially after not raising the price in the United States since 2018 that the time was right to raise it. And we think it\u2019s a much more valuable program today than it was in 2020, let alone 2018. So, other countries, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate every year and nothing else to announce right now. On supply chain, there\u2019s specific things that I think we all see in the supply chain where we\u2019re waiting for products. But as far as Amazon is concerned, we did a lot to combat the supply chain issues we saw in Q4 or anticipated in Q4. We bottled product ahead. We work with vendors to secure inventory early, in some cases, paid earlier, which had a working capital impact.", "484": " So, we did everything. We knew how to as far as trying to get more capacity in a constrained market. And we think it worked for our customers in Q4 as challenges remain in \u201820, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve totally passed that, but we don\u2019t expect it to be a big issue in Q1.Operator: Our final question is from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.Dan Salmon: First, I just wanted to follow up a little bit and see on the advertising numbers, if there\u2019s any qualitative color that you could add, say, rough balance of performance advertising versus brand advertising, maybe U.S. versus rest of the world. Anything you add could be great. And then, just second, Brian, you mentioned the exclusive broadcast of Thursday Night Football and is one of the reasons supporting a higher price increase for Prime. Dave, you mentioned it as an element that is a dynamic new one for the advertising business. Maybe could we just return to that point as the sort of importance of live sports in the video space is incredibly important, is that one that you see kind of taking the business to a new level at this stage?Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that second question. So, I didn\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that we raised prices because there\u2019s any football. I just use that as an example of great new content that we\u2019ve been investing in for Prime members to make the Prime membership more valuable as well as international sports, we had one of the highest rated games in the Q4 with, I believe, is Manchester United and -- I\u2019m going to mix up the team, sorry.Dave Fildes: Arsenal, I don\u2019t know.Brian Olsavsky: Yes, I won\u2019t embarrass myself. But, the -- so again, we\u2019ve been working on getting sports properties that will be beneficial and valuable to prime offering. We\u2019re still probably early on in that. We\u2019ve had obviously success with Premier League Soccer, other soccer leagues around the world, Tennis properties and also probably the marquee as the work with the NFL on Thursday Night Football.Dave Fildes: Dan, in terms of just break out, I think as we\u2019ve said before, on the advertising side, the sponsored products and brands, they make up the majority of the ad revenue today.", "485": " But suffice to say, a lot of these efforts, Brian talked about, whether it\u2019s on the video, advertising opportunities for -- in those sponsored products and sponsored brand efforts, we\u2019ve replicated a lot of the tools and features and services around the world and are kind of constantly learning and building out the brand and the presence with that so we can make better inroads with customers over the long term.Brian Olsavsky: And because I don\u2019t want to leave you hanging, Dan, the Manchester United and Arsenal soccer game in December was the most watched Premier League match ever on our service with an estimated viewership of 4 million. So, I think that is actually pretty interesting because we\u2019ve had a lot of increasingly good relationship with the Premier League. We\u2019ve had Boxing Day games, and we continue to be a valuable partner for each other.Dave Fildes: With that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least three months.", "486": " Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Quarter 4 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2023 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements.", "487": " And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments about our Q4 results. Let's start with revenue. For the fourth quarter, worldwide net sales were $149.2 billion, representing an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and above the top end of our Q4 guidance range. We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money. Throughout Amazon's history, we have found that our focus on the customer helps to set us apart in times like these. This past holiday season, customers came to Amazon for great deals, fast delivery and our widest-ever selection, bolstered by nearly 2 million third-party seller partners who sell on Amazon. Enterprise customers continued their multi-decade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work. In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty and softlines. Our teams worked hard to offer low prices and secure millions of deals for customers in Q4, including our first-ever Prime Early Access Sale in October and the more traditional Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend. These global sales events outperformed our expectations as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing selection. Third-party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection. In Q4, sellers comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales. Sellers, vendors and brands continue to look to Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers in the always competitive holiday season, even as the macro environment required them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets. We saw good growth in advertising revenues in Q4, up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.", "488": " Along with competitive pricing, broad selection and faster delivery speed, we've seen Prime members respond to our expanding entertainment offerings. During the quarter, we completed our first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the most watched Amazon original series in every region of the world, reaching over 100 million viewers and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. We also finished our inaugural season as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football, reaching the youngest median age audience of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and increasing viewership by 11% from last year among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds. In aggregate, we invested approximately $7 billion in 2022 across Amazon Originals, live sports and licensed third-party video content included with Prime. That's up from about $5 billion in 2021. As a reminder, these digital video content costs are included in cost of sales on our income statement. We regularly evaluate the return on the spend and continue to be encouraged by what we see, as video has proven to be a strong driver of Prime member engagement and new Prime member acquisition. Moving on to AWS. Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.", "489": " Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the quarter, we reported $2.7 billion in operating income. The operating income was negatively impacted by 3 large items, which added approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This was related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment and operating leases and changes in estimates related to self-insurance liabilities. This cost primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not incurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. We are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our Amazon stores business. We entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to demand across our operations network compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right labor in the right place at the right time and drive productivity gains. We also saw continued efficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in higher Amazon Logistics productivity and improved line haul fill rates. While transportation overperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our fulfillment centers, in line with our plan. We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday volumes. Overall, it was a strong effort by the operations team, and we look forward to making further headway as we head into 2023. We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network and reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience. Circling back to the 3 large charges during the quarter. Let me share some additional color, starting with the job eliminations we initiated during the fourth quarter. As we consider the ongoing uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, this led us to the difficult decision to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, primarily impacting our stores and device businesses as well as our human resources teams. As a result, we recorded estimated severance cost of $640 million. These charges were recorded primarily in technology and content, fulfillment and general administration on our income statement. Next, we recorded impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, primarily related to our Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go physical stores. We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers, will build our grocery brand and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time. As such, we periodically access our portfolio of stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential.", "490": " The impairment charge in Q4 was $720 million and is included in other operating expense on our income statement. We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity, and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels, whether that's online delivery, pickup or in-store shopping. Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general product and automobile self-insurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted claims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of sales on our income statement. As our business has grown quickly over the last several years, particularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network and claim amounts have seen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted claims as well as our estimate for unasserted claims. We reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $2.3 billion included in nonoperating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations but rather the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. As we head into the new year, we remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.Andrew Jassy: Everybody, this is Andy. Just before we start with the questions, I just wanted to say it's good to be with you all on the call today. I thought I might jump on the calls from time to time moving forward. And given that this last quarter was the end of my first full year in this role, and given some of the unusual parts in the economy and our business, I thought this might be a good one to join. So thanks for having me.Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.Brian Nowak: I have two. Andy, I want to ask you, just the first one, you've been in the seat for a while.", "491": " And then the second one, just sort of staying on the North America retail side, how do you think about the potential margin potential of that business over the next few years as you sort of grow into the warehouse? And what are the warehouse network? And what are the efficiency factors to get you to those goals?Brian Olsavsky: Brian, this is Brian. First, let me just start with your second question. On the -- sorry, can you hear me? On the expectation for retail margins, especially in North America, what we've said is when we look back to our cost structure pre-pandemic, we were just in the end of 2019, early part of 2020. We're just starting to roll out one-day shipping in North America, and we had an expectation of what our cost structure would look like. That has changed quite a bit in the last 3 years now due to a doubling of our network expansion. I think you've heard me tell this story on different calls. But essentially, we're now trying to, again, regain our cost structure that we've had in the past, balance the -- and get more efficient on the assets we've added in the last 2, 3 years now and also look at all the investment areas that we are working on to drive growth, continuing to look at them where we need to make course corrections, where we need to change things up. And we expect that, again, a lot of the improvement will be in North America operations costs. We made good headway in 2022. We always want to make more, and we're going to be working on this definitely through 2023 and beyond. But we hope to make and expect to make big improvements in 2023.Andrew Jassy: Yes. And I'll start just at a broad level, priority-wise, the connective tissue for everything we do across the company, including in stores in North America, is we realize that we exist to make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly went to do so. And being maniacally focused on the customer experiences, always going to be a top priority for us.", "492": " As I addressed directly the North American stores questions, I think our -- probably the #1 priority that I spent time with the team on is reducing our cost to serve in our operations network. And as Brian touched on, it's important to remember that over the last few years, we've -- we took a fulfillment center footprint that we've built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years. And then we, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile roughly the size of UPS in a couple of years. And so when you do both of those things to meet the huge surge in demand, you're going to -- just to get those functional, it took everything we had. And so there's a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient and more productive. And then I think at the same time, if you think about doubling the number of fulfillment centers you have and then adding a very large transportation network and you realize that all of those facilities have to link together to get products to customers, that's a pretty big expansion in the number of nodes in the network. It becomes a little bit different network. And so to figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and have them be highly utilized and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, it takes time. So we're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. But that work will extend into '23. So that's first. I think the second thing, priority-wise, I would talk about is just speed. We believe that continuing to get products to customers faster, makes customers happier, and they also converted a higher rate when they can see promises of deliveries that are faster. I think selection will always be a very high area of focus for us. We work with hundreds of thousands in the U.S. and millions overall in the world of selling partners. In this past quarter, 59% of the units sold were from our third-party selling partners, and we work very hard to provide unmatched selection. And that matters a lot to customers. I think pricing being sharp is always important.", "493": " And then just the customer experience improvements that we're working all the time, whether it's adding Buy with Prime that allows Prime users to use their Prime benefits on other websites than just Amazon; or adding RxPass in the health care space, where our Prime customers for $5 a month can get all the medicines they're using in unlimited fashion; or whether it's just even in our apparel business, where when you're looking clothing you might buy, being able to see virtually your shoes with that outfit to see how it looks and it changes your customer experience, your buying experience, we will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned.Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.Douglas Anmuth: Also for Andy, I have two. Just first, how would you evaluate your efforts in grocery thus far? I know you're -- it's a big, huge market. You're attacking it different ways. What are the key steps here that you're focused on to drive greater market share? And then secondly, how should we think about the strategic importance of some of these emerging bets type of areas like health care and Kuiper and autonomous vehicles, among others?Andrew Jassy: On the first one on grocery, I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us. It's a very large market segment, and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery. And we also believe that over time, grocery is going to be omnichannel. There are going to be a lot of people that order their grocery items online and have it delivered to them, and there are going to be a lot of people who continue to buy in physical stores. But you're going to also see a hybrid of those, where people pick out what they want online and pick it up in stores, or people are in stores and there's something that's not in inventory in the stores, so they go to their app or to a kiosk and order it to be delivered from online. And so I think having omnichannel is going to really matter. And I think that we have a pretty significant-sized grocery business. I think people sometimes don't realize that and that we've been building for a long time.", "494": " If you think about the online grocery offering, we have a very large business there. It looks different from the typical mega physical grocery store. But if you think about the aisles in a grocery store, from packaged food to paper products to canned goods to pet supplies to health and personal care items to consumables, we have a very large business there that continues to grow at a rapid clip and then we think will continue to grow. But it doesn't have a big market segment share in perishables. And if you really want to have significant market segment share in perishables, you typically need physical stores. And we have kind of 2 different offerings there. For what I think is the very best organic physical store experience and selection, we have Whole Foods, which is a very significant-sized business that's continuing to grow. I really like the progress that, that business has made on profitability in the last year. And I like what I see in front of it, and I think that's a very -- it's a premium product, but it's a significant business. It's a good business for us in the grocery space. I think if you want to have a mass physical store offering, you need a different offering. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh, and we have a few dozen stores so far. We're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers. It's differentiated in some meaningful fashion and where we like the economics. And we've been -- we've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh doors until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like, but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023. We're working hard at it. We see some encouraging signs. And when we do find that equation, we will expand it more expansively. But I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment. I think we're building a pretty broad grocery network across online and physical, and you're going to see us continue to work on it.Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.Eric Sheridan: Maybe I'll ask one big picture of Andy and then just a housekeeping matter to Brian, if I can.", "495": " Obviously, you're in a range of geographies with a wide variance of maturity and different investment cycles. Can you give us your perspective on how you see Amazon's global e-commerce footprint today? And how investors should be thinking about the mix of growth and margin evolution in those international businesses in the years ahead? And maybe, Brian, if I can just ask a quick follow-up. In the Q1 operating income guidance that you gave, I think there's some confusion among investors as to where you might be capturing some of the restructuring charges from the announcements that the company has made on employee count between Q4 and Q1. Can you just clarify what was captured in Q4 versus what might be included in the way you frame the Q1 operating income guidance?Brian Olsavsky: Sure, let me start. This is Brian. Let me start with that second part. So as I said earlier, we took a $640 million charge tied to the position elimination that we announced in Q4. A lot of that fell into Q1 into mid to late January. So the way to think about it is for the terminations in January, the salaries for the first 3 weeks are covered in operating results for Q1. But the period after that, where there's weeks or months of severance coverage, job placement, a lot of those costs are what the $640 million charge was in Q4. So I hope that helps.Andrew Jassy: And on the question about international e-commerce, we're very enthusiastic about the business we're building there. I think just perspective, if you look at the compounded annual growth rate from 2019 to '21, in the U.K., it was over 30%; in Germany, it was 26%; in Japan, it was 21%. And the fact that we haven't given back that growth, and these are all net of FX, but if you look at even the last couple of quarters where we're continuing to grow and we haven't given back some of that growth, a meaningful amount of market segment share has shifted to our global established e-commerce territories, and we're excited about that. Now we're -- at this stage, we're big enough in our developed international territories that when there's something significant happening in the macro, we're going to be impacted as well.", "496": " So you can see that in some of our growth numbers. And then you look at our emerging countries, and these are -- they're all a little bit different in all -- in a little bit different stage as you recognize in the question. But if you look at countries like India and Brazil and the Middle East and Africa and Turkey, Mexico and Australia and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing. They take a certain amount of time. There's a certain amount of fixed investment you have to make when you enter a new geography, and then you have to drive a certain amount of revenue to be able to cover that fixed investment. But they're all on the right trajectory and following trajectories that roughly look like what we saw in North America and our established international geographies, and we think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large profitable international e-commerce business.Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.Justin Post: Great. Maybe one for Andy and then one for Brian. AWS, if you look at the revenue growth of mid-teens, it implies it could be flattish and even down this quarter. So maybe talk about what's driving that. Is it workload changes? Are there some clients that are shifting? Anything on the market share you could comment on? And then second, when do you think this could recover? Like what's the time frame? And would you expect margins to come back when revenues reaccelerate? I'll leave it at that.Brian Olsavsky: Thanks, Justin, for your question. This is Brian. Let me start with the -- what we're seeing at the customer level. So as I've mentioned, continuing -- it's across all industries. There are some points of weakness, things like financial services, like mortgage companies that do. As mortgage volumes down, some of their compute challenges or compute volumes are down. Crypto is -- lower trading in crypto. And things tied to advertising, as there's lower advertising spend, there's less analytics and compute on advertising spend as well. But -- so there's . But by and large, what we're seeing is just an interest and a priority by our customers to get their spend down as they enter an economic downturn.", "497": " And we -- there's things you can do. You can defer -- you can switch to lower-cost products. You can run calculations less frequently. There's just -- you can do different types of storage on your data. So there's ways to alter your cost and your bill in a short period of time. I think that's what we're seeing. And as I said, we're working with our customers to help them do that. And again, we're seeing ourselves at Amazon. So I'll let Andy add some color on kind of the general trends in AWS, but that's more what we're seeing at the customer level right now.Andrew Jassy: So I would just add -- I mean, I think Brian covered a bunch of it. I think most enterprises right now are acting cautiously. You see it with virtually every enterprise, and we're being very thoughtful about streamlining our costs as well. And when you are being cautious, you look for ways that you can find -- you can spend less money. And where companies can cost optimize or, in some cases, they may be used to doing analysis over 90 days of information and they say, \"Well, can I get away with it for 2 weeks, doing 2 weeks' worth,\" it's not necessarily the best thing long term. But a lot of companies will do that when they're in uncertain economic situation. And the reality is that the way that we've built all our businesses, but AWS in this particular instance, is that we're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money. We are not focused on trying to optimize in any one quarter or any one year, we're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlast all of us. And so if it's good for our customers to find a way to be more cost effective in an uncertain economy, our team is going to spend a lot of cycles doing that. And it's one of the advantages that we've talked about since we launched AWS in 2006 of the cloud, which is that when it turns out you have a lot more demand than you anticipated, you can seamlessly scale up. But if it turns out that you don't need as much demand as you had, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it.", "498": " It's something you can't do on-premises, which is one of the many reasons why the cloud is and AWS are very effective for customers. I think -- and I've spent a fair bit of time with the AWS team on this, and we look closely at what we see. We have a very robust, healthy customer pipeline, new customers, migrations that are set to happen. A lot of companies during times of discontinuity like this will step back and think about what they want to change strategically to be in a position to reinvent their businesses and change their customer experiences more quickly as uncertain economies emerge, and that often means moving to the cloud. We see a number of those pieces as well. And we're the only ones that really break out our cloud numbers in a more specific way. So it's always a little bit hard to answer your question about what we see. But we, to our best estimations, when we look at the absolute dollar growth year-over-year, we still have significantly more absolute dollar growth than anybody else we see in this space. And I think some of that's a function of the fact that we just have a lot more capability by a large amount, with stronger security and operational performance and a larger partner ecosystem. So I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at an event which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business.Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.Ronald Josey: Maybe a bigger high-level question here just around Prime member engagement and just seeing third-party seller services growth accelerating in the quarter. And I believe it was mentioned that customer is spending more on everyday essentials, which may be a relatively new use case. Talk just a little bit more, maybe Andy and Brian, just around how engagement is evolving here for Prime members and really how this has grown wallet share over time and where this is going.Brian Olsavsky: Yes.", "499": " I would say that the Prime membership is -- remains strong and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member. It varies a bit by geography. But in general, if you step back, we had some very large video properties that we had launched last year, Thursday Night Football and Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. Both of them had record sign-ups for Prime membership. And we know that, again, investments like that will help with not only a new member or new Prime member acquisition, but also retention. And we see a direct link between that type of engagement and higher purchases of everyday products on our Amazon website. So the health of Prime is very strong. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are continuing to work to get our speed of delivery up to get more one-day shipments. And we think that will also be well received by Prime members. But it's a combination of price selection and convenience. I think we've made inroads on all of them, especially with the third-party selection that's been added over the last few years. So I think testament to that is the sales that we had in the fourth quarter. In a very competitive and deal-driven environment, people came, Prime members and others came to Amazon to do their shopping. So we're encouraged by it.Andrew Jassy: Just to add really one piece here, which is just, if you step back and think about a lot of subscription programs, there are a number of them that are $14, $15 a month really for entertainment content, which is more than what Prime is today. If you think about the value of Prime, which is less than what I just mentioned, where you get the entertainment content on the Prime Video side and you get the shipping benefit, the fast shipping benefit you can't find elsewhere and you get the music benefit, you get the Prime Gaming benefit and you get the photos benefit and you get the Buy with Prime capability, use your Prime subscription on websites beyond just Amazon and some of the grocery benefits that we provide, and RxPass like we just launched to get a number of medications people take regularly for $5 a month unlimited, that is remarkable value that you just don't find elsewhere. And we will continue to add things to Prime and continue to experiment with lots of different features and benefits. But it's still early days.", "500": " So we're optimistic about it.Operator: And our final question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.Mark Mahaney: Two questions. Brian, just any color on why mid-teens is kind of a holdable growth rate for AWS over the next couple of quarters, given what looks like pretty clearly, continuing deterioration in enterprise demand? And then, Andy, I wonder at a high level if you could just talk about how your priorities may have changed or the company's priorities may have changed over the last year or so as you've been the CEO. And it looks like there's a bit of a peel back on devices, a peel back on physical stores, except for groceries and then maybe a little bit more of a lean in on health. And I'm not quite sure what you're doing with entertainment content spend like that. Maybe it's the same, maybe it's a little bit more. But just at a high level, how would you say your priorities have changed or are different than the prior CEOs?Brian Olsavsky: So on the AWS growth rate, I'm not sure I can forecast for you with any level of certainty what is going to happen beyond this quarter. You kind of -- this is a bit uncharted territories economically. And as we mentioned, there's some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing. So I don't have a crystal ball on that one, but we are going to continue to work for to be there for our customers. And as I said in the earlier comments, we do have new deals. We have new workloads coming to the cloud. The value was there. And whether there's short term, perhaps short-term belt tightening in the infrastructure expense by a lot of companies, I think the long-term trends are still there. And I think the quickest way to save money is to get to the cloud, quite frankly. So there's a lot of long-term positive in tough economic times. Saw that in 2020 when volumes for customers shifted very quickly. It led to a resurgence after that and probably acceleration of people's journeys to the cloud, and we'll just have to see if that happens again with what we're seeing today.Andrew Jassy: Yes.", "501": " And I think that if you look at the last couple of years with things like the pandemic and the labor shortage in 2021 and the war in Ukraine and inflation and uncertain economy, good leadership teams look around and try to figure out what that means and how they should adjust their businesses. And so if you look at -- in the early part of 2022, I think we realized that as we tried to make sure we met the surge in demand for consumers and sellers and having to make decisions in 2020 for what fulfillment network investments we're going to make in 2022, we just had more capacity than we needed. And you saw us in the early part of 2022 delay some of our builds and mothballed some of our facilities to try and be more economic. And I think when we look at some of our physical business investments, physical store investments, I think there were just some areas where we didn't have conviction that they were going to be big needle movers for Amazon. And so that's why we closed down our 4-Star bookstores. And as we got into the early part of the summer, where we start our operating planning process, we -- and there was a lot of things happening in the macro economy, we started that process with the high-level tenet of we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs in all of our businesses, not just their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making. We want to actually do a pretty good, thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we need to, but doing so without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic investments that we think could change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over time. And you saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount as we tried to assess what was happening in the economy, and we eliminated some programs in fabric.com and Amazon Care and Amazon Glo and Amazon Explore. We decided to go slower on some -- on the physical store expansion in the grocery space until we had a format that we really believed in rolling out and we went a little bit slower on some devices, and until we made the very hard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been a part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles.", "502": " Now we have a way of looking at investments that is different maybe from some other companies. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. It's just the way we look at it, which is when we think about big areas to invest in, we ask ourselves a few questions. We ask, if we were successful, could it really be big and move the needle at Amazon, which is a high bar at a place like Amazon? Do we think it's being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have some competence in those areas? And if we don't, can we acquire them quickly? And if we like the answers to those questions, we will invest. Sometimes, that leads to very logical extensions for people. When I got to Amazon 25 years ago, we were a books-only retailer. And when we expanded into music and video and electronics, that seemed pretty natural to people. Amazingly, people were very surprised we were expanding into tools. That seemed far field for people, but it turned out not to be. When we launch something like Buy with Prime, I think people see that as more predictable. That process has also led us to less predictable investments. And I remember, I had a front-row seat in the AWS experience, having worked with the team and led the team from the very start. And I remember both externally and internally, there were a number of people who wondered why we were doing that. It was so different from retail only. But think about how different a company Amazon would be today if we hadn't invested in AWS. And so that informs some of the other meaningful investments we're making beyond our stores, in retail and advertising and AWS businesses. I think that while we've gone slower in some devices and things, we still -- when we look at the answers to those 4 questions, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in streaming entertainment devices, our low Earth orbit satellite and Kuiper, health care and a few other things. And I think that do I think every one of our new investments will be successful? History would say that, that would be a long shot. However, it only takes one or two of them becoming the fourth pillar for Amazon for us to be a very different company over time. So I think it's very worthwhile. We're going to continue to invest.", "503": " A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months."}
